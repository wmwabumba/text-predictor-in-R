A. This genetically altered form of wheat has been transformed into such a destructive "food" that any amount has the potential to trigger undesirable consequences. For instance, there's what I call the "I had one cookie and gained 30 pounds" effect. ... One day, you go to a dinner party and they're serving some delicious looking bruschetta hors d'oeuvres. You say, "What the heck!"... Before you know it, the floodgates of appetite have been reopened by exposure to the gliadin protein of wheat, the component responsible for triggering appetite — and you promptly gain back 30 pounds.
"Overall, I think it is worth exploring and certainly should cost less than that fiasco we almost got New Jersey into," he said.
The situation is not better for apps aimed at children. On Feb. 16, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report titled "Mobile Apps for Kids: Current Privacy Disclosures Are Disappointing."

"It's visual. People don't like what they do to their lawns and it touches them in an emotional way. The tension builds and they keep buying more stuff (to get rid of the pests). Finally, they get to the point where they say, 'This animal has to be dealt with.'

A At this stage of the vehicle's life, I don't think this is a significant problem. It doesn't affect dependability or utility. Having replaced the engine mounts, the only other item I would check would be the vacuum system for the power brake booster. A leak or low engine vacuum at idle due to age and mileage would certainly amplify the roughness. A cylinder balance test might identify a somewhat weak cylinder as a contributing factor. Regardless, I'd be very hesitant to spend any serious money on additional diagnostics or repairs.

Before the law went into effect, neither New Jersey nor out-of-state wineries could ship their bottles directly to customers here unless they did it through a wholesale distributor. The new law cuts out the middle man, allowing wineries to earn more profit per bottle by selling them directly to customers at retail prices. It also made available a permit for out-of-state wineries to sell to New Jersey customers.

Simon and Brian Eno work so well together here you’ll wonder why they never thought of collaborating before. Every lyrical detail is matched by a commensurate musical element — sometimes a synth texture, sometimes a treated backing vocal, sometimes something undefinable. This is Simon’s summary of life during wartime, and it’s suffused in unease. But if he doesn’t see a way out for himself, at least he’s got some cold advice for his daughter: “You don’t need to waste your time worrying about the marketplace/Trying to help the human race/Struggling to survive its darkest night.” He tucks this into a sentimental lyric with the skill of a housekeeper at a four-star hotel turning down a bed.

We are immediately absorbed, even as we recognize that we are captive to a narrator who has good reason to skew her accounting.

I'm thinking that was what Stephen Foster was thinking, too, when he wrote "Old Folks at Home" in 1851, which has been the official state song since 1935. Over the years, the song has inspired criticism for the insensitive and politically incorrect references to slavery and use of plantation dialect in its original lyrics. In 2008, the Legislature designated that a revised version of the lyrics be the official version.

There was a sommelier there who wanted to be kind so he gave us a bottle of Nuits-St-Georges Burgundy. It was a very good vintage as I recall.

Sutherland has a much larger body of work to cover than Walter Scott did with his 1825 "Lives of the Novelists," and trying to fit all of Sutherland's witticisms into a newspaper review would be as impossible as listing all 294 included authors.

I believe that there are no easy answers on how to fix this funding crisis and that it is going to take all sides coming together in a pretty major compromise.

Skylar singing is definitely the most southern twang I've ever heard on a Whitney Houston song, but overall, it worked — really well. After last week's upbeat performance, Skylar laid down the law on how wide her vocal range is, belting out the country-fried ballad. The judges' notes: Beautiful, amazing and HOT. Side note: No matter how she fares on "Idol," there must be a number of country-western labels salivating at the chance of signing Skylar. She is country youth personified.
Democracy will inevitably bring Islamist groups into Tunisia's political mainstream. A few conservative voices have already made rumblings about revising aspects of the Personal Status Code, whereas moderate Islamists are quick to express support for women's rights and adherence to the current code. Rachid Ghannouchi, head of the formerly banned Islamist party Nahda, was once critical of the Personal Status Code and the country's anti-polygamy laws on religious grounds, but by the late 1980s he had come to terms with it. He recently returned to Tunisia after exile in London and has again reaffirmed his support for women's rights. The question is whether Ghannouchi's brand of moderate Islamism will carry the day in Tunisia.

I find that the recent editorial in The Sun regarding Social Security falls far short of the reality of the situation ("Social Security sets off sparks," Sept. 14). Joe Biden said the same thing the editorial did on a CNN interview before the last Republican debate. It's easy. "A simple thing," he said. If it's so simple, then why hasn't anyone fixed it? Because it's not simple.

Still, Brown was not booked on suspicion of physically hurting the woman. Pickett said a criminal threats charge indicates a person makes a threat and has the capacity to carry it out.
Thrift stores are most likely to stock polka-dotted blouses, skirts and dresses, since these garments traditionally have been done in dots. Depending on store inventory, you may find pieces from the full-skirted '50s and the mod '60s as well as the occasional pair of polka-dotted palazzo pants from the late '80s. Pin-dotted blazers and slacks may turn up, too, but to capture the trend this time around, hold out for penny-sized dots or larger.

If Obama had a willing Congress, we might have a fighting chance. But politics and the looming election year block the nation's path to progress.
Rather, it's a fundraiser for the state GOP and a daylong political festival at Iowa State University. Presidential candidates make speeches and try to lure the most supporters to the event — with promises of food, live music and, sometimes, a lift to the site — in hopes of getting their backing in a nonbinding vote. The labor-intensive exercise gives candidates a chance to test their campaign operations and turn out supporters ahead of the winter caucuses.

Before I headed home, Tshering and I had a more typical tourist day in Thimphu. We visited the post office where I enjoyed having an official postal stamp made with an image of Tshering, Karma and me, found a gho and a kira to take home and made a trip to the Motithang Takin Reserve to check out the national animal of Bhutan, a large mammal that resembles a mash-up of a buffalo, antelope and goat. I thought I had abundant memories and packages to take home, but there was one more.

"In a young woman under age 30, we'll do an ultrasound first, but we don't screen the whole breast first," said Kinsell of Summa. "Women between 35 and 40, that's a little bit of a gray zone.

As the world shrinks, one is increasingly grateful for glimpses of cultures, farflung in time or place, that stir up one's inner Tintin or Conan Doyle with a sense of irreducible mystery. The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) seems dedicated to bringing us just such glimpses—in the most scholarly way, of course, it being a branch of New York University. The Institute's whimsically old-world setting accentuates the feeling of discovery. You walk into a repurposed townhouse—externally discreet, internally grand—just off upper Fifth Avenue and find a wholly unimaginable experience, an encounter, say, with 3000 B.C. Nubia or with Danube Valley relics from 5000 B.C. (two shows from recent years). The current show, "Nomads and Networks: The Ancient Art and Culture of Kazakhstan," couldn't be more splendidly esoteric, focusing as it does on that most perennially opaque of the earth's remote regions, the vast steppe-lands of Eurasia.

Cleveland fans deafeningly booed him.
Since Occupy Oakland began, Jordan said, his officers have interacted with more than 60,000 protesters, but have only arrested a fraction of that number. Those figures prove, he said, that Oakland police are intending only to arrest those acting violently.

The result: Pujols, in more of a protect than attack mode, has swung at too many pitches out of the strike zone, producing weak contact and more strikeouts.

The back story gradually widens to reveal Luke's past, though the revelations come as cheap plot solutions to explain why he speaks fluent Russian or has secret access to the mayor of New York (Chris Sarandon).

"A credit score of 750 buys you 4.3 percent rate on an auto loan, but a 580 gets you 17 percent for same exact car. So you're paying $170 more per month, for a $20,000 loan just because you have poor credit."

Sanctioned and unsanctioned visual practices coexist, bleed together. We see it in this recent pair of photos, too. In the first, one soldier leans intently over the insurgent body, ignoring the camera, while the other soldier, with the dead man's hand resting limply on his shoulder, turns his sweaty face away from it and smiles. In the second photo, some of the Americans are occupied with something beyond our view, while a few of their comrades insert themselves awkwardly into the frame behind the legs of a corpse, which the Afghan police suspend by its ankles, one looking impassively at the camera, the other gazing downward and intent at the remains. For all the clarity with which the pictures depict the viscera of the dead and the faces of the men sent to sort them out, they also testify to the murkiness of the boundary between visual practices that are sanctioned and those that are not. They document the ease with which a visual mission can devolve.

Kovarik also invented a similar product for siding - you know, the under parts that the power washer can't seem to clean. That will be my next purchase.

The nipped-waist, full-skirt, almost petticoated silhouette that introduced the female characters in season one, set in 1960, would look out of touch with what was happening in the world just a few years later. After Jackie Kennedy started stepping out in more body-conscious sheath dresses and looser shifts, everyone did.

The company danced Peter Anastos' "Footage" with more confidence than in its winter premiere. In this retro cocktail danced to 1930s standards recorded by Jack Hylton & His Orchestra, the men delivered terrific timing and high energy in the demanding ensemble work, which required double tours and high-flying jetes from beginning to end. Though played with fine comic timing by Laura Dunlop and Michael Galloway, a campy war of the sexes needlessly upended the effervescent Fred-and-Ginger mood.

In Atlanta, there is evidence that not all the positive reviews were deserved.

It helps if you know the territory — New York's East Village and small-town Vermont, 1987 to 2006, but anyone can recognize the disorientation of the generation raised by hippies.

Acting training is a lucrative industry, and DLS has something his father, who died when he was 11, was sometimes criticized for lacking: a business acumen that recognizes the opportunities in a global brand. Armed with an MBA from the UCLA Anderson School of Management and a wealth of administrative experience (he worked for then-Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan as a member of the Economic Development team after the 1994 Northridge earthquake), DLS is particularly excited about the opening in 2010 of a Strasberg Institute in Mumbai, India. This is the first of no doubt other international ventures, which he sees as a vital engine of growth now that a long-term arrangement with NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, an affiliation that provided roughly 20% of the institute's students, is coming to a close.

It also has a new set of owners -- which is good, because many guests have complained for years about the property's deterioration. Fortunately, the makings of a great retreat are still here, beginning with the stonework and grotto area that is the heart of the resort. Once those new owners have renovated some rooms, get one near the grotto.

The movie is a little predictable, at times – complete with a somewhat forced ending and that awful, on-the-nose title. But the acting is all easy and natural. The score – apart from a relentlessly crude rap that starts things off – is moody and often beautiful. And the message – that prejudice exists in every community – is one worth listening to.

With a base at 7,000 feet and a top of 8,700 feet, this place gets a ton of snow, and so it was on our recent visit.

The campaign-as-warfare metaphor may seem sensible to those inside the hothouse. It may make sense if you think today's swing voters hunger for more combat, more harshness and more attack. But it's probably bad sociology and terrible psychology, given the general disgust with conventional politics.

If I were Obama, I'd play to his personal popularity and run an "American Idol" campaign: likability, balance, safety and talent. If I were Romney, saddled with his personal diffidence, I'd run a plumber campaign: You may not love me, but here's four things I can do for you.

If you've ever indulged in a glass of the fortified sweet wines port or Madeira, chances are that Rupert Symington had something to do with it. Symington's ancestors first produced port in 1652; today, the Symington Family Estates portfolio includes Graham's, Warre's, Dow's, Smith Woodhouse, and Cockburn's as well as the Madeira labels Blandy's, Cossart Gordon, Leacock's and more. In recent years, this historic conglomerate has been updating its image with dry table wines from Portugal's Douro Valley and single-vineyard ports, without giving up its age-old tradition of farming some of the world's most challenging vineyard terrain in the most natural way possible. When Symington recently swung through town, we asked the Anglo-Portuguese wine-biz whiz about the current state of fortified wines.

southern California one Advent Sunday. The sanctuary was filled with folks longing for Rev. Robert Schuller's usually upbeat proclamation. As the service began, an announcement was made regarding the church's then-legendary "Glory of Christmas" pageant. The show, now discontinued because of the Cathedral's financial problems, was a full-featured theatrical production with angel's flying through the air, orchestrated musical numbers, and a cast of hundreds. Schuller sold the show with his dynamism, his voice thundering: "And there are camels!" On his cue, large adult camels walked down the sanctuary's center aisle. But he still had one more card up his pulpit robe. Grinning from ear to ear, he announced that the church was flying in actual shepherd boys from Palestine.

According to federal data, the head honchos of the big health insurers fared splendidly in 2009 while other Americans had to make do. For instance, their CEOs' compensation was $18 million at Aetna; $13.1 million at WellPoint (Anthem); and $8.9 million at UnitedHealth.

Olsen is not playing a plucky Jamie Lee Curtis ("Halloween") variation here. She plays Sarah as paralyzed, with paroxysms of fear that have her stifling screams, gulping because she keeps forgetting to breathe. That makes her the perfect surrogate for the horror movie fan, overwhelmed by what is happening, stunned into inaction by a confrontation with what could be the supernatural, and deaf — stone deaf — to the shouts of "Don't go in there" and "Get out from under that bed" — from the audience.
While Minnesota's five-officer fugitive unit may seem small compared to the number of people who have bolted the system, they are not alone in their efforts.

While McCormick thinks Smotrycz would have been a big part of Michigan’s future, landing at Maryland seems to be an ideal fit for the Reading, Mass., native. McCormick likened Smotrycz to Khris Middleton, a 6-foot-7 forward at Texas A&M who earned All-Big 12 honors under Turgeon in 2010-11. Both Middleton and Smotrycz are known as highly skilled offensive players that can “always improve defensively and in toughness and rebounding.” Turgeon, McCormick said, is the perfect coach to bring out those qualities in Smotrycz.

But affordable, safe and full diagnosis starts with the training of our next doctors, in medical schools. It extends to working doctors whose fee-for-service business model now pays them more every time they assign a new test. It extends to hospital systems needing to pay off hefty CAT scan and MRI installations, payments that come in part from heavy use. Most of all it extends to patients weaned on the belief that technology saves, and all that's medically knowable is good -- when in many cases it is not.

African Queen re-launched in Key Largo -- Visitors to the Florida Keys can again take a ride on the African Queen, the iconic original vessel from John Huston's classic 1951 film by the same name starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Registered as a national historic site, the African Queen recently received a major $70,000 restoration project that included structural, mechanical and cosmetic repairs. The African Queen has an interesting 100-year history that began when it was built in 1912 at England's Lytham shipbuilding yard. Originally named the Livingstone, it served the British East Africa Rail Company shuttling cargo, hunting parties and mercenaries on the Ruki River. Situated in the northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo until 1968, according to Jim Hendricks Jr., Huston saw it and the vessel was temporarily pulled from service for the film. In 1982, late attorney (and Bogart buff) Jim Hendricks, Sr., discovered the vessel languishing in an Ocala horse pasture and purchased the piece of movie history for $65,000. An equal amount of funds was invested to get the boat operational and Hendricks began offering visitors rides in 1983 while the vessel was home ported at Key Largo's Holiday Inn. In 2001, the African Queen's engine broke, was never fixed and yet it remained on display for curious tourists and film buffs to view. Last year, Captain Lance Holmquist and Suzanne Holmquist signed a long-term lease with Jim Hendricks' son to restore and operate the vessel again. The Holmquists have overseen repairs and have taken pains to date it as it appeared in the film. Plans for the African Queen include offering 90-minute canal cruises several times daily and dinner cruises on selected nights, all from the Holiday Inn Key Largo, mile marker 100 ocean-side, on the Florida Keys Overseas Highway. Costs are $39 per person for the daytime cruise, $25 for children under 12 and the dinner cruise is $89 per person, including the meal. Call 305-896-8004.

He was a teen idol in the early ’40s — as big a teen idol as the world had ever seen. But by the end of that decade, the hits stopped coming and some — even Sinatra himself, briefly — believed he was washed up. But, sparked by an Oscar-winning performance in the 1953 movie “From Here to Eternity” and by the talents of some new musical collaborators (including, crucially, the Jersey-born arranger Nelson Riddle), he re-emerged as a more mature but equally thrilling recording artist and concert performer.

That was the case until the oil crisis of the '70s. I reminded them that prior to that the station wagon dominated the roadways much like SUVs do today. The profitable solution to both manufacturers and buyers in the '70s was the compact car.

She and Gina are now allies, which is stunning enough. I'm also aware of a lawsuit George filed against her to get back the ring he gave her before he dumped her for Lauri - a six-carat VS1 diamond valued at $200,000. Oh, and Gina's mother - the grandmother of the four children George and Gina have together - has weighed in. She's concerned that those kids "are just as threatened and in jeopardy as Josh" because of the anxiety caused by all the litigation George has brought.

The singer has no plans to star in movies, as far as I know, but her performance on stage at the Grammys got me thinking about movies.

There was no bad experience, and he grew attached to the coaches he met at each stop.

Tinker goes to camp: Legendary Nike/Jordan Brand shoe designer Tinker Hatfield has his imprint on some of the best known footwear produced inside the berm at the Beaverton-area world headquarters.

There is a fine balance that needs to be maintained between commercial coverage and public programs to allow a hospital to continue to serve the community. In every case of a hospital closure in Greater Cleveland in the last 30 years, shifts in this balance of payors has been a key factor.

Neither rider in the Jeep was hit in this burst of gunfire and they then drove into the tunnel, officials said.
Yet South Carolina voters want to hear about these issues, and in depth. If Iowa showed anything, it is that in this age of Obama and high unemployment and terror threats, even cultural conservatives are voting on more than faith. That explains the growing fight over whether Mr. Santorum should have won the recent endorsement of a group of 150 social conservative leaders—or whether the nod should have gone to Mr. Gingrich. The social right is as split as anyone.

WR Hakeem Nicks. As aggressively as the Seahawks’ corners were playing, I’m surprised the Giants didn’t look more often for the back-shoulder throw that was so effective against the Cardinals. They did it once to Nicks for 16 yards in the third quarter, but not so much other than that. Nicks, by the way, becomes a much different player in the red zone. That’s why he’s getting this game ball. Another tremendous grab on the TD, which is usually when he makes his best catches.
Commas seem to be the persistent problem, Frost said. That is, they are seldom used.

Funny thing, as different as each level is -- and there is a considerable gap between playing with the De Soto Parks traveling team in a tournament at Jackson and playing with the Gallagher premier squad in the national tournament finals at Phoenix -- the challenge always is the same for a goal scorer -- get open, get the ball, get the shot off.

No fancy, artsy pizzas here! There are only about 7 toppings available at Farinacci Pizza, but in this case, less is more. We opted for a plain cheese as well as the deluxe, which includes sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, onion and green pepper. Anchovies were also offered, which, by a 1-2 vote, I gladly accepted on the side. The crust stood out the most, it was chewy and delicious. The cheese-to-sauce ratio was perfect. The supreme pizza was generously topped, with the spiciness of the sausage nicely balanced by the saltiness of the anchovies. This is classic American pizza.

Phil Mickelson, the last American to win a major, knocked it all over the place but pulled off a nifty up-and-down at the final hole to salvage a 70. Defending champion Louis Oosthuizen struggled to a 72 that should have been better with an afternoon tee time.
"You don't want to leave your friends and teammates behind after battling beside them all year, but my first thought was excitement," he said.
For decades, many European companies had enjoyed deals that granted them half of the high-quality oil produced in Libyan fields. Some major oil companies hoped the country would open further to investment after sanctions from Washington were lifted in 2004 and U.S. giants re-entered the North African nation.

Matt Michels - agreed with the industry view that the beef has been unfairly maligned and mislabeled and issued a joint statement earlier saying the product is safe.
In Annapolis, state lawmakers are considering bills to expand gambling in the state, a move supporters say is vital to remain competitive in the Mid-Atlantic region, where states such as West Virginia and Pennsylvania offer both slots and table gambling. State officials are also considering bids for casinos in Baltimore and Western Maryland, which would round out the gaming program under the current law.
"In this business, every day is a day you grind it out," Davidson said. "But when you have an hour in the hotel room at night and look at the standings, you feel good. And I feel good, not for me, but for the players, the coaches, and the people who have supported us all the way through.
"Ted Thompson and I sat down and the final question gets asked: if Nick was your son, would you let him play?" McCarthy said. "So that's why we made the decision we did."
"The problem with Newark is that if you look at other suburban areas, classificiation of autism is done much earlier in those communities," she said. "How can it be Newark classifies kids at such a late stage? What we know is that Newark has one of the lowest graduation rates in New Jersey and has tremendous challenges."

In 2005, PepsiCo's food division began a quest to make its Lay's potato chips more appealing to local tastes in Russia. It wasn't easy. Russians still like packaged versions of a Soviet-era snack , stale bread slathered in oil and baked to a crisp.

It helps that director Nancy Carlin prefaces the antiheroic epiphany with strong doses of romantic Balkan music. And with Maggie Mason's Raina, the room's inhabitant, and her mother (Lisa Anne Porter) shrieking like schoolgirls over the Bulgarian cavalry charge, led by Raina's fiance, that scattered the invading, Austrian-led Serbian troops - Swiss mercenary Bluntschli among them (real war, 1885).

Indeed, the administration points to successful efforts to identify those who are receiving unwarranted tax breaks for nonprofits or brownfields, worth a collective $2 million. But that success comes with a key caveat — identifying money the city is owed is not nearly the same thing as collecting it, and that process is difficult. For starters, the city isn't the one that administers the homestead tax credit program. It can forward the names of those it believes are undeserving to the state Department of Assessments and Taxation — and it already does for rental properties — but that state agency is the only one with the power to actually revoke the credits.
"I think the numbers we have in our system are not bad," he said, "but we still need to make sure it doesn't get worse and hopefully improve those numbers."
It makes sense financially for districts to take students, but some school leaders are a little nervous about taking all students.
It was with much puzzlement that I read David Brooks's discussion (9/14/11) of evidence that the great majority of American young adults are depressingly -- indeed, alarmingly -- unable to distinguish right from wrong, confront moral dilemmas or interpret the meaning of life. Puzzlement because of the famous religiousness which so conspicuously distinguishes Amertican culture from that of western Europe.
- Teary-eyed Sandinista leaders bade farewell to the "older brother" of their revolution at a dramatic midnight funeral and President Daniel Ortega declared three days of national mourning. First lady Rosario Murillo said in a cracking voice that movement founder Tomas Borge was "one of the dead who never die."

Nicholson — hair slicked back, in finely tailored suits — is not your father's detached noir detective. The labyrinthine storyline still challenges and surprises. Dunaway is impeccable, giving the performance of her career. Huston, at once charming and creepy, embodies his role and, as the director of 1941's "The Maltese Falcon," brings a palpable sense of history to this revisitation of the genre.
"It’s the money," said Stephen Nacco, executive director of public relations at Brookdale Community College in Monmouth County. "Students will save a lot of money taking a Brookdale class at $118 a credit as oppose to some other university at $600 a credit. An increasing segment of the population is doing that."
The state-owned firms approved by China for an asset freeze were among 40 proposed by the council, diplomats said. Beijing generally opposes economic sanctions and is one of North Korea's few allies.

Tiger Woods's victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational is notable for a bunch of reasons, but it may ultimately be remembered as the tournament at which golf's greatest scrambler reinvented himself as a merciless ballstriker. This has profound ramifications for Woods's quest to win five more major championships and accomplish his lifelong goal of breaking Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 career majors."
The truth, of course, is that this state and nation has long kept a balanced budget and managed to care for its most vulnerable residents.
Roadblocks have cropped up along the way. Civil unrest marred a handful of Flowermarts in the 1970s, and a lack of interest (as well as fresh blood) led to its cancellation in the mid-1990s.

Sneakers haven't been just sneakers since 1985. That's when the NBA fined Michael Jordan for wearing his black and red Air Jordans because of uptight rules about shoe colors. Jordan was fined $5,000 for every game he wore them  and he kept wearing them. It created buzz and changed perceptions.
Conforto didn’t experience those losses last season, but he’s heard plenty about them from his teammates. The sweep ended OSU’s hopes of winning the conference title and provided a highlight for Oregon in an otherwise disappointing season.
While the spending reduction isn't much, Christie's right to say his proposed budget is smaller than the fiscal year 2010 budget in place around the time he took office.

Walker was the same player who said Wednesday he thought the Greyhounds could run on the Buckeyes because their bench was short. In talking after the game, he said he hopes Ohio State wins the national championship.
But what made the claim truly bizarre is that two days later, Mr. Cain branded himself a victim of racism. Specifically, he said some black people are "racist" because they disagree with his politics. So blacks aren't held back by racism, but Mr. Cain is?

The last player to hit four home runs in a game was Carlos Delgado on Sept. 25, 2003, for Toronto against Tampa Bay.
That last goal is by far the most important. If the communities of Cuyahoga County -- and their neighbors throughout Greater Cleveland -- can reduce the time and red tape it takes to do business here, this will become a far more attractive place to invest. As the economy becomes more robust and the pie grows larger, squabbles over "poaching" should subside.
Fans and critics have measured the poor guy's words all season, criticizing Cho for being soft spoken and careful with what he says (and who wouldn't be post-Pritchslap Era?). I'm still trying to figure out how much autonomy he really has, and whether he'll be a difference-maker for the organization. But I'm thinking we're going to learn as much as we ever have about Cho in the next seven days.

"You always look for what's happening in front of you and I was lucky enough that horse (Morgan's Guerrilla) just drifted at the right time, just as I was getting toward him," Russell said. "It just made my job a little bit easier in regards to riding the horse and steering him at the same time."
We don’t need new community centers as long as we have school buildings.
The Taittinger and Mumm wines showed distinct geographic differences, though the house styles were easy to detect. Among Taittinger's generally understated wines, the two best were the 1998 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs, though it revealed few signs of its $150 price tag, and the Domaine Carneros Brut Rosé ($35), which didn't clearly divulge its roots. (My best guess? "French, probably.") Mumm's best showings were its all-Chardonnay NV Mumm de Cramant Champagne ($61), which spoke fluent French with its bready, herbaceous nose, and the NV Mumm Napa Reserve Brut ($26), which offered a Champagne-like minerality.
As its offense tried to find rhythm, MU also was buoyed by punter Trey Barrow, who in his first start averaged 44.7 yards on seven kicks - including a 57-yarder and a 38-yarder that pinned Miami at its 1-yard line in the fourth quarter.

Earthquake drill: Washington County agencies will join emergency exercises Tuesday to practice responses to an earthquake. A county news release outlines details on the exercise and tips to stay safe during an earthquake.
First on the list is a poise that doesn't get rattled by peripheral issues - former pitching coach Dave Duncan once described how late room service would aggravate Garcia - or allowing an inning to unravel. In his first start of the season, Garcia coolly escaped first-inning trouble and rolled through six innings.
Other emergency units that responded included the Bound Brook Police Department, Bound Brook Rescue Squad, Martinsville Fire and Rescue Squad and the Finderne Fire Department.
Sanders started having words with George Hill when West came to his teammate's defense. Sanders acted like he was going to go after West, but never got close. Granger also exchanged words with Sanders.
With such a tight shooting schedule, they didn't have the luxury of rehearsals to develop a husband-wife rapport. "Fortunately, Jessica has a really big heart," said Shannon. "She radiates warmth. I've worked with some other people where you're supposed to be boyfriend-girlfriend and it just doesn't click. I think that's one reason everyone wants Jessica in their movies. She brings that vulnerability and heart that she puts into everything she does."

The library also offers a computer lab for Fairmont's children, as well as board and video games, which she says are hot commodities after school. Many students who can't get homework help from Spanish-speaking parents can go to tutors at the library.
Like the Orient Express of the movies, our train swirls with dark rumors to explain our long delay in this Chinese version of Tijuana: The Mongolian locomotive needed to take us north didn't arrive. The Chinese want bribes to let us go. The Russian train we're supposed to transfer to has mechanical problems and can't leave. Nothing substantiated, but truth never gets in the way of a good round of gossip.

Obama, without mentioning anyone by name, noted Republican candidate Mitt Romneys column in the New York Times in November 2008 headlined "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt." And he pointedly said that while some - including Romney - suggested private financing and a managed bankruptcy could have saved the companies, that there was no such financing available and everyone knows it.
You let him know otherwise, and I know this not just from the amount of angry reader response, but from the dozens of servers who wrote or called to tell me about the big uptick in customers who left tips in cash and often registered their disgust with management.

If the mayor takes a voluntary leave of absence, he can appoint the township business administrator, clerk or a township director to step in as interim mayor and serve 60 days in the position before council picks a new interim. If he resigns, the township Republican committee will have 15 days to submit three names to council, who will then be responsible for choosing a replacement. The same process was used when former councilman Tom Goodwin resigned to ascend to the state Senate in 2010.
In October 1995, Lane's father, Thomas Michael Lane Jr., told deputies that the boy's mother, Sarah Nolan, had punched him and bit his arm during an argument. She was later convicted of disorderly conduct. A judge who placed her on probation in 1995 also ordered her not to drink.
The Dakota County Master Gardener Program is enrolling kids for its Junior Master Gardener project May 29 to Aug. 28 at UMore Park in Rosemount.
Plus, again, evidence of a sharp uptick in such shenanigans would suggest that new accountability measures are getting some response: Teachers and principals who can’t get it together to deliver better results are at least moved to cover up, distort and fudge. They really believe they’ll pay a price if they’re caught failing.
missed opportunities still added up to a victory for Rex Ryan and the New York Jets.
"Nobody's been at the table since June," said Express Scripts spoksman Thom Gross. "Nothing's going on there, but we never say never."
But as John Farrell reminds us in his biography of a titanic American personality, Darrow was no left-wing saint. He was always in need of money and agreed to defend gangsters, bootleggers and crooked politicians for large fees. During his single term in the Illinois state legislature he fought for municipal control of streetcars and other utilities, then turned around and represented two Chicago streetcar companies as a lawyer. Although he was acquitted of bribing jurors during James B. and John J. McNamara's trial for bombing the Los Angeles Times building in 1910, Farrell judges that Darrow was "almost assuredly" guilty — and that wouldn't have been the first time.

The exceptional gifts of a once-enslaved population have attracted many foreign observers; the exceptional corruption of governments, with a host of other handicaps, have brought the former "pearl of the Antilles" down to its rank as the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, seemingly truly cursed by fate. It didn't need the earthquake of Jan. 12, 2010, despite the Rev. Pat Robertson's now-famous racist gloating over it.

Miskell's Evan grows delightfully without losing his beguiling naivete. O'Connor's Jasper is a bundle of nerves and aspirations beneath a static exterior, while Thigpen's becalmed KJ conveys volumes of information in long silent stares. Both are damaged goods, which tends to make the many small ways in which they take care of each other all the more moving. In the underlying kindness of these stunted lives, Baker gives us rays of hope amid bleak prospects.
Thus the Mets rolled the Marlins, who experienced a most-unpleasant three-game set here at Citi Field. Jose Reyes, Miami’s $106 million shortstop, went 1-for-12. Mark Buehrle, the club’s $58 million starter, lost on Wednesday. And Bell, the $27 million closer, blew his third save, lost his third game and appeared helpless during a 46-pitch, four-walk debacle.
Relocating also gives the 7-year-old nonprofit a chance to do more advocacy work, he said.

That’s not just the sentiment from the press box. It’s coming from the head coach. It’s coming from his young players. Rutgers has now won five straight bowl games, the longest streak in the nation, but even a loss on a bigger stage next year would be better than returning to another minor game.

This is the world we live in, or so we keep being reminded — often when we have allowed ourselves to forget, momentarily, the evanescence of the every day. It is all up for grabs all the time, and ahead of us, as Kunzru writes, "lay only a vast emptiness, an absence. There was nothing out there at all." To confront these ideas is like staring into the abyss. Still, there are hints, whispers, not quite promises but (maybe) patterns, suggesting more at work than meets the eye.
Denihan was referring to the crippling funding cuts his agency will absorb in coming weeks. In the budget that Gov.

In the clubhouse after the game, Duda’s surge was still approached with a bit of lighthearted skepticism from teammates, though. His first home run of the afternoon was the first in the new, shorter Citi Field to see the direct benefit of a smaller park.

Confronted with calls for Parks' removal from an unusual coalition of police-reform advocates and the department's rank and file, then-Mayor James K. Hahn chose not to renew Parks' contract in 2002, provoking a firestorm of opposition in black L.A. that contributed to Hahn's ouster in the 2005 mayoral race. Parks, a master of the politics of payback, played his role in Hahn's defeat, running an anti-Hahn campaign in the 2005 primary, then endorsing Hahn's chief rival, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the runoff.

Many of these costs were unnecessary. We chose to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan with a small, all-volunteer force, and we supplemented the military presence with a heavy reliance on civilian contractors. These decisions not only placed enormous strain on the troops but dramatically pushed up costs. Recent congressional investigations have shown that roughly 1 of every 4 dollars spent on wartime contracting was wasted or misspent.

It is on most lists of the top man-made wonders of the world — it boggles the mind to think how workers toted the huge stones that make up the buildings and terraces to the heights, especially because the Incas did not have the wheel.

Thanks to those assets, Social Security probably has enough on its balance sheet to pay full benefits for two decades. But the trustees expect the gap between payroll tax revenue and benefit payments to grow rapidly later in the decade, with interest-fueled surplus turning to deficits around 2021.

Despite her character's at times painfully obvious wrong choices, Thirlby, probably best known for her sidekick role in "Juno," came to feel particularly in tune with and personally connected to the character. Working for the first time with a female director, Thirlby especially appreciated the way in which Russo-Young captured the ripple effect of Martine's actions.

I have learned more from the financial task force than the city council. Now I know why these task forces are formed in the first place. Why should our paid city council persons do the work when they can get someone else to do it for nothing. And that's why I think the council should get a stipend and no benefits. After all, their own part-time employees don't get benefits why should they?

Author Chris Mooney compiles much of this research for his new book The Republican Brain, which purports to show that conservatives are, literally by nature, more closed-minded and resistant to change and facts. His evidence includes the fact that conservatives are less likely to buy into global warming, allegedly proving they are not only "anti-science" but innately anti-fact, as well. "Politicized wrongness today," he writes "is clustered among Republicans, conservatives and especially Tea Partiers."

A molecule derived from two amino acids, L-carnitine occurs naturally in the body, where it's made by the liver and the kidneys. Its job is to carry, or "shuttle," fatty acids into cells, where they're burned for energy. Carnitine deficiencies are rare; most people make enough of the molecule on their own. Carnitine also occurs naturally in a variety of foods, including red meat, tempeh, avocados and asparagus.

The directors of Spielberg's generation who came up in the late '60s and early '70s, many of them film-school-trained, were the first in America to push their encyclopedic passion for movies right into the forefront of their work. Their rebellion against Old Hollywood was essentially a pose, since directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks and Frank Capra were mainstays of their mindscapes. Old movies functioned for these filmmakers as primary experiences -- touchstones of inspiration -- in the same way that poetry or literature might have functioned for an earlier generation of artists.

A: It's a matter of protecting yourself as best you can. We defer a lot of that, obviously, to the international legal community.

We're going to pass $1 billion this year. Other companies have found a way to do it. There are all kinds of risks involved, but it's about assessing risk vs. opportunity. It can't be enough to just bury your head in the sand.

The books you want to keep on your shelf are the ones that your kids will want to read over and over. But some picture books are particularly good for the experience of one perfect "aha!" moment. A family might not want to spend $16.99 for that one moment, but give that book as a gift to a classroom and multiply that one moment by years and classrooms full of "ahas" — then, it will start to look like a bargain. James Rumford's "Rain School" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: $16.99, ages 3-7) takes place in a village in Chad, where students spend the first weeks of the new school year building their schoolhouse out of mud bricks; only then does the chalkboard come out. Lessons go on until the rainy season comes. The mud wall and mud desks melt away, as the illustrations show the vibrant colors of Africa giving way to the grays of torrential rainfall. But it "doesn't matter," the book concludes, underlining — for a lovely aha! — what is ultimately of value: "The letters have been learned and the knowledge taken away by the children. Come September, school will start over."

After an ugly start to last season — the nearly fatal beating of a Giants fan in the Dodger Stadium parking lot on opening day — the Dodgers earned a lot of respect for their finish. Players bought what manager Don Mattingly was selling, and they finished in third place. The Dodgers have the division's top pitcher (Clayton Kershaw) and top returning player (Matt Kemp). Still, their lineup has arguably four No. 8 hitters. Be warned. This is the year to keep the Dodgers under thumb before they add the likes of Cole Hamels and Josh Hamilton in free agency.

A lawyer for Adams did not return a call seeking comment. But his friends and family defended his reputation. His mother said he never would have jeopardized his dream job. His wife offered stacks of unpaid bills to show they were not living extravagantly. His father-in-law called him "one of the good guys." According to the investigation by state and federal authorities, though, Adams had been using methamphetamine for at least nine months, with a man who became a government informer.

In January 1978, the Somoza regime was seriously weakened when opposition journalist Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, editor of the newspaper La Prensa, was murdered by a hired gunman named Domingo Acevedo and four accomplices. Chamorro's widow, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, blamed the assassination on officials in the former Somoza government, who fled into exile after the dictator was toppled. All five gunmen were later convicted, but Mrs. Chamorro pardoned them after she was elected president in 1990.

He was, in general, unsuited to radicalism.
That's how I was drawn to "Risen 2: Dark Waters," despite never having played the original or knowing little about this sequel. Developer Piranha Bytes had me at "Ahoy matey." For those going into the game blind, it's an uneven beginning. Players are expected to know what's going on with the Nameless Hero, and the background is poorly explained.

T-Lish newbies can be easily fooled into ordering too much food. The eight varieties of tacos are $3.95 each, four for $13 and 10 for $31, but at about 4 ounces each, these dwarf your standard taqueria and truck fare. Unless you've got a ridiculous appetite, one snack, two tacos and possibly a side, along with the constant resupply of the freshly made chips from La Palma tortillas and house-made salsa, are more than enough for two to split and feel full.

Perhaps because of the heat, Springsteen starts out with four rousing songs in a row: a taut cover of the Clash’s anthemic “London Calling,” followed by “Badlands,” “Night” and “She the One.” Later highlights, though, come from two moodier, rarely played songs — “Racing In the Street” and “Trapped” — as well as an remarkably buoyant “Johnny 99.”

On the opening day, the printouts presented to General Tommy Franks indicated that 22 of the projected bombing attacks on Iraq would produce what they defined as heavy bugsplat — that is, more than 30 civilian deaths per raid. Franks said, 'Go ahead. We're doing all 22.'"

I loved Rickey Henderson, loved watching him play, was transfixed by the athleticism and intensity he brought to the game. As I kid I was really tempted to turn him into an idol. He came from Oakland, that crime-ridden underdog of a city where I was born, and there was a tremendous emotional connection between him and his hometown fans. And although he could be cocky, even boastful, he had some great qualities, too, most notably his preternatural level of discipline. In the end, though, the thing to love about him was the way he played baseball; he was fast, smart, joyful, and a thing of beauty as he rounded bases. And that was enough.

The media no longer cling to the results of the nightly news wars the way they used to. The public's appetite clearly has slackened for a set half-hour of news, at a fixed time early each evening.

The remaining viewers, more than one wag has noted, get bombarded with ads for gout treatments, heartburn ills and other products for the older demographic.

It's frustrating to see an almost total lack of top-flight apps for Android tablets. I can't share in the joy that others seem to take in seeing Android gasping for air like this. I think it's almost time for Google to wipe the slate clear, so to speak, and start all over again.

1. The Warriors will tank, but the Lakers have to be careful. With eyes on a possible high lottery pick, the Warriors have lost 17 of their last 22 games since trading away Monta Ellis to Milwaukee for Andrew Bogut. So no need to worry about the standings implications regarding this game. The Lakers will add some cushion to their half-game lead over the Clippers for third place in the Western Conference. With the sidelining of Warriors starters Stephen Curry (right ankle sprain), Bogut (fractured left ankle) and David Lee (strained groin), there's no conceivable way the Lakers can lose this game. Unless they go out of their way and try really really hard to do so just for kicks.

The Ransom Center made its mark by taking the road less traveled; in 1957, when it was founded, that untraveled path led to contemporary 20th century writers. Other more established libraries and museums vied for Gutenberg Bibles, illuminated manuscripts that were hundreds of years old, and original works of the canonical writers of the 18th and 19th centuries.

He has his theories on why a team that started so hot -- 7-2 and atop the Western Conference -- faltered so spectacularly in his final days. And he has some regrets, both with how the roster was assembled and how he handled some of those players. But he was steadfast in taking the high road.

So is menopause even a factor here? Is the link between changing midlife hormones and brain fog real? That, says Julie Dumas, of University of Vermont's Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit, remains uncertain. Past efforts to find a clear link between menopause's plunging female hormone levels and changes in cognition haven't yielded a clear link. (Although mood change s-- which can lead to changed intellectual performance -- are well linked to menopause's hormonal changes.)

Throwing caution to the wind, the dancers pulse from elbows, shoulder, hips. They curve their spines into arcs and crouches, and strange polyrhythmic blurs take possession of their wrists and feet. And they look as if they fear nothing - whether asked to prance wide-eyed across the stage in a "crazy chicken" dance, hobble in small circles, or simply lift their heads to smile creepily at the audience, they give the full measure of commitment to every moment without the least embarrassment.

The Tigers were ahead in game one of the doubleheader, with Baltimore at bat in the top of the sixth inning. Storms were predicted for the area, with these 'thunderheads' beginning to roll into the greater Detroit area at this point. Big John (Boog) Powell had just stepped into the batter's box for Baltimore; Mickey Lolich was hurling for the Tigers. We were sitting on the third-base side, between the Detroit dugout and the backstop, approximately 20 rows back. Suddenly, a tremendous lightning bolt came down out of the sky, directly striking the top of the light tower located right down the rightfield line! Several pieces of metal fragments dropped down off of the roof into Kalines Corner in rightfield. Needless to say, the game was halted at that point; and it wasnt able to restart later. The Tigers were declared the winners, and Game 2 was postponed. Even though we were present for the final game, nevertheless, the bright flash of light and the loud clap of thunder were dazzling. Certainly one of my more interesting memories of the grand 'ol lady at The Corner."

Leaving the backyard behind, I eventually managed to get myself to a place called Cerocahui somewhere in the top of the canyons.

A: The flowers of melons, cucumbers and squash have male and female flowers on separate plants. If the flowers open and a female flower does not get pollinated, the small undeveloped fruit behind the flower will abort. Lack of pollination can be the result of not having both the male and the female flowers present on the same morning, or if both are present you did not have pollinators working that morning. You can pollinate the female flowers yourself by clipping a male flower from a plant (the flower with a regular stem behind it). Peel the petals from that flower so they are not in the way of your work and gently dab pollen onto your female flowers (the ones that have a bulge at the stem attachment). One male can pollinate four or five female flowers. With pollination, the fruit behind the female flower will further develop into your harvestable fruit.

While “Let it Rain” is the most obvious hit on “The Sound of a Million Dreams,” it’s not the best song on the set, or the most effective application of Nail’s narrative skills. “Half Mile Hill” is an examination of small town wanderlust that draws a parallel between a father ditching his family for selfish reasons and a singer abandoning his girlfriend to chase glory. It’s an advanced piece of storytelling, and Nail is up to the task. Even better is “That’s How I’ll Remember You,” a power ballad about a breakup that Nail sells with his earnestness. (Some tasty drum fills help, too.) “Catherine,” the only song on which Nail takes full writing credit, is another winner: a Black Crowes-style dedication to the singer’s wife.

Nicholas J. Cotsonika, Yahoo! Sports: The day the Nashville Predators welcomed back Alexander Radulov, throwing a press conference in his honor, presenting him with his old/new No. 47 sweater, general manager David Poile repeated the line he had been using often. 'We're all in,' Poile said. The Predators were proud to be sitting at the high rollers' table. They were pushing all their chips into the middle, going for the big prize, the Stanley Cup. But the gambling metaphor was apt. When you go all in, that means you're risking everything. Now the Predators are in danger of going bust. It looks like they were dealt a bad hand. Facing a 2-0 deficit in their second-round playoff series with the Phoenix Coyotes, they have suspended Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn – one of three players Poile added before the trade deadline – for violating team rules."

Major leaguers, all of whom understand what it is to be gifted, have been uniformly and extraordinarily welcoming to Jon, who is not.

Honda's proposed class action settlement might cost the carmaker $40 million, if every one of the 200,000 Civic Hybrid owners claimed the maximum amount. But if all of the owners went to small claims court and fared as well as Peters, the company would be out nearly $2 billion.

But polls agree that much of the population remains undecided — as high as 56 percent according to one.

North Korea is separated from the more prosperous South Korea by a heavily militarized frontier, and access to the country remains strictly controlled. The communist government's monopoly on information began to erode in the late 1990s, when famine led to less reliance on and trust in the state, Kretchun said.
The look of Nua, which means new in Gaelic, is sleek and cool, and is a pleasant contrast to the warm Mediterranean flavors favored by Bautista, who broadly interprets the cuisine of three countries. The words at the bottom of her menu -- "Good Appetite" translated into French, Spanish and Italian -- signal the food's leanings. While many dishes sound familiar, she executes them in stylish ways.

New York-style pizza is also famous for its thin crust. It's what makes the pizza so foldable.
Warren's return — he signed a two-year contract last summer — is one reason the Broncos haven't done anything at defensive tackle in free agency this year. They still believe Warren can be a productive starter. But he has played only one game the last two seasons because of injuries, so they're rolling the dice on his availability.
Chapman, who guessed that the child was less than 21 month, couldn't hear what was said, "but the body language did not appear comforting."
Cabrera, meanwhile, may not have liked the money or years offered by the Tribe. Or he found the idea of being a big fish in the 2013 free-agent pond inspiring. Of course, that would require two more seasons like 2011.
After countless delays, one of five defendants left in legal limbo — a naturalized U.S. citizen and former cab driver named Karunakaran Kandasamy — is up for sentencing Friday in federal court in Brooklyn.

On their football recruiting trips they asked football coach Mike Riley why the Beavers didn’t have a men’s track team and what the possibility was that OSU might get one.
Chris Christie has advertised his availability, but the New Jersey governor is too charismatic; he'd remind everyone that the guy at the top is as scintillating as a plate of vanilla. Jeb Bush has the wrong last name. Bob McDonnell, the Virginia governor, wants the job so badly that he's running TV ads touting himself, but he won't help Romney with women, not after signing the bill that requires women to undergo ultrasounds before an abortion. Mitch Daniels, the Indiana governor, has home-state fiscal woes - and he was George W. Bush's budget guy when the surpluses vanished and the red ink began to cascade.

Enbrel (outside U.S.) Rheumatoid arthritis $899 million $870 million up 3 percent
I'm not sure how much the league can control in order to pump up the suspense, short of adding an element of surprise and shock by letting an Al Davis hologram pick for every team. You'd expect him to pick Andrew Luck for the Colts. But given the Raiders' penchant for stunning the crowd and the commentators by over-reaching on selections, Hologram Al might just hand deliver the Colts a kick returner from Bethune-Cookman.
The limited-edition collection, which will be available through March 6, will include apparel, handbags and scarves. The price range is $19.99 to $59.99. If the Wu collection catches on like last fall's Missoni launch at Target, here's hoping the retailer is prepared both in store and online.

Matta keeps putting up 20-win seasons and Big Ten championships, and maybe this team has a Final Four run in it. Texas, Kansas, Pitt and, especially, Duke, if injured freshman guard Kyrie Irving comes back, are all formidable, too.
At first glance, Loyola's resume this season is equally — if not more impressive — than the Blue Jays'. The Greyhounds' 12-0 start matched the school's best opening and they are the top seed in the ECAC.

Smith reported to the Cardinals' complex at Roger Dean Stadium on Saturday to start a weeklong stint as a guest instructor. New manager Mike Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak reached out to Smith this past winter to extend an invitation to, in Smith's words, "reconnect."

The ISM manufacturing index is closely watched in part because it's the first major economic report for each month.
"We're just not stopping in those dangerous areas," Hawks captain Jonathan Toews said. "We're swooping through hoping to get offensive breaks and go the other way on odd-man rushes.

Put it this way: If something like the financial crisis of 2008 had occurred in, say, 1971 -- the year Richard Nixon declared that "I am now a Keynesian in economic policy" -- Washington would probably have responded fairly effectively. There would have been a broad bipartisan consensus in favor of strong action, and there would also have been wide agreement about what kind of action was needed.

It's a really great hike.
"If I had anybody else I could talk to about this stuff, I'd go there," Nick says. Monroe grudgingly shares his savvy about the ziegevolk creatures, who have a mysteriously powerful effect on their prey, like "preachers," "game show hosts," and "actor types," says Monroe. They give off a sort of scent, he says: "Chicks can't resist it." Monroe goes down Memory Lane, recalling a short, tubby old acquaintance named Elvis Greenspan who really had a way with the ladies, courtesy of his ziegevolk mojo. Oh, and if one of these goat guys touch you, Monroe adds, they own you.

Another brilliant season, another heartbreaking semifinal loss for Tottenville. It doesn’t get any tougher than Saturday’s 20-17 overtime loss to Erasmus Hall in Huguenot, the Pirates leading 14-0 at one point late in the first half, only to fall agonizingly short. With so many key losses, from Syracuse-bound wide receiver Alvin Cornelius to middle linebacker Kenny Coughlin, the Tots may not get so close next year.

After the first few weeks of engaged euphoria mellow out, and you stop staring at your ring instead of the road while driving, it's time to focus on the task at hand. There are a zillion and one details to iron out, and as a first-time bride, you probably have no clue where to begin.

It's safe to say that fight has been won. Alameda now has vigorous requirements for historic review, as I can attest, having paid several hundred dollars for city approval to tear down a nondescript, rotting wooden shed and replace it with a garage that would match the architectural lines and stucco exterior of my 1920s-era Mediterranean. I appreciate the city's newfound vigilance on protecting older structures, even if the fees seemed excessive.

His father Michael Thomas was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and his late step-father, actor Dennis Hopper, was an avid collector.

Then Severna Park took the air out of the ball. The Falcons controlled the possession for most of the rest game before turning the ball over with 1:50 left. Broadneck raced down the field, getting the ball to Probst directly in front of the cage. Her high point-blank shot was stopped by King. The Bruins got the ball back again with 32 seconds left, but they weren't able to get off a good shot.

You see, Barry is one of the greatest free throw shooters who ever lived. When he retired, Barry held the NBA record for most consecutive free throws made (60), highest free throw percentage in a season (.947) and best for a career (.900).

J. Edgar is, of course, J. Edgar Hoover, the longtime director of the FBI, rumored to be a closeted homosexual who maybe dabbled in cross-dressing, as well. All of these aspects of his life are covered, as is his opportunism. Hoover was around for so long -- he served as FBI director for nearly 50 years -- that he was something of a law-enforcement Forrest Gump, present for some of the biggest crimes of the 20th century, and quick to take advantage of them to further his professional and personal interests.

There are many other long-standing and highly visible brand images which have had some graphic cosmetic surgery.

The Quaker Oats logo guy may have been stylized and polished a few times, but his facial features have been pretty constant for decades.

The average age of the state's population, as in the nation, is rising, partly driven by the aging of the huge baby boom generation, whose oldest members were born in 1946 and are of retirement age. The USC researchers say the number of Californians of retirement age compared with people of prime working age (25- to 64-year-olds) will rise to 36 seniors per 100 working-age adults in 2030. It stood at 22 to 100 in 2010.
NFC EAST: Yesterday’s column was devoted fully to the Eagles, so I won’t rehash only to say once again second-round pick Vinny Curry, the defensive end from Marshall by way of Neptune High School, was a real good pick. When the Giants sat at No. 32, they had three players in mind: Virginia Tech running back David Wilson, who they selected; LSU wide receiver Reuben Randle and UConn defensive lineman Kendall Reyes. So when they got to 64 and Randle was still on the board, it was a no-brainer for GM Jerry Reese and his crew. For once, Dallas owner Jerry Jones didn’t let his ego get in the way and mess up the team’s draft. The Cowboys actually made a good, calculated move up in the first round and got the guy, LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne, who might be the safest pick in the draft. By that, I mean at worst Claiborne will be a solid cover corner; at best he becomes an All-Pro. Washington might have become the biggest joke in the league. With all kinds of needs on a team that finished in last place in the division for the third time in four years, the Redskins took two quarterbacks with their first three picks.

You drive the Audi TT. From its earliest days as a 1995 Frankfurt auto show concept car—penned by a team led by Americans J Mays and Freeman Thomas (both now with Ford)—the TT has presented itself as a car designed for design connoisseurs.

The pure, simplified volumes; the constant-radius curves of the nose, tail and roofline; the nearly horizontal speed lines streaking back from the headlamp enclosures to the wraparound taillamps. All this high geometric cool comes to us from the era of Streamline Moderne industrial design.

Château de Beaucastel produces a stupendous Châteauneuf-du-Pape blanc, and its Paso Robles property, Tablas Creek Vineyard, turns out a white in a similar spirit called "Esprit de Beaucastel Blanc." It's no mistake that so many Central Coast winemakers have gravitated toward Rhone varietals. This blend of primarily Roussanne with Grenache Blanc and a little of the livelier Picpoul Blanc is a great tribute to the Rhone with its scent of white peaches and honey, bracing minerality and lush texture.

Among those who voted "no" on the 1989 tax-raising conference report was future House Speaker William Batchelder, a Medina conservative in what was then an embattled House Republican minority. Batchelder said that because neither the House nor the Senate had proposed the gas tax increase, slipping it into a conference report was unconstitutional and illegal. Batchelder was right. But Joe and Joan Taxpayer didn't then, and don't now, have top-dollar Columbus lawyers on retainer to challenge such antics. And the highway lobby wasn't about to.

Yauch, who was 47, achieved fame with the Beastie Boys, but as their fame grew he directed his energy toward his lifelong passion: Buddhism and Tibetan independence. While he and his fellow Beastie Boys Mike Diamond (Mike D) and Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) continued to transform rap music through classics like "Paul's Boutique," "Check Your Head" and "Ill Communication," Yauch helped tether the group with his rhymes about peace, enlightenment and other topics far removed from the party-rap of the Beastie Boys' early music.

My son's recovery passed quietly, with DVD rentals filling the time, in earth-shaking contrast to his great-grandfather's interrupted recuperation of a century before.

Another favorite is the Smokin' B.L.T., made with tempeh bacun, greens, avocado, red onion, cucumber, tomato and chipotle aioli ($11). Sandwiches are served with a choice of fresh fruit, hummus, veggie sticks or super kale salad. Substitute a cup of soup or pommes frites for a buck.
We returned to class. With the grace of a surgeon, Eley dismembered the remaining half of the hog. "We butcher anywhere from eight to 15 hogs a week, which we sell at Goose (the Market) and at local farmers markets," he said.
Still, I figured I'd answer Patrick, since I didn't want to waste more time, so I typed in the little window: I'm looking for black sweatpants.
The history of Captain America in the comics is fascinating. His adventures were first recorded in a series that began in 1941, as Cap entered the war long before America. His famous first issue shows him doing what many Americans wanted to do: punch Hitler in the face.

In this day and age, everyone is a reporter – as many athletes and celebrities on the wrong side of a camera phone often find out the hard way.
Today, however, many Americans are personally uncomfortable with Islam. One kind of discomfort is actual Islamophobia — and it is usually easy to spot. There are many more voices that decry obvious anti-Muslim statements and actions than support them. The second kind is more subtle but still hurtful. It includes the behavior of my friends, who are not anti-Muslim at all but nevertheless say unkind things sometimes.
A friend brought this bottle of crisp, minerally Graves over for dinner and I immediately fell for it. Like most whites from Bordeaux, Chateau Graville-Lacoste's 2009 is a seamless blend of Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc. The Semillon fleshes out the Sauvignon, giving this blanc a touch of golden color and flavors of melon.
In 2009, the city put forth a revitalization plan that involved the city government; Arcturis, an architecture and design firm; the Washington University Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts; and construction companies.

Finally, his mother, Kathy, orders him to sit down and discuss the pros and cons of each school. Everything Ryan lists is about the football team of each school -- not the school, itself. And he regrets that when he shadowed a student at St. Ignatius, it was a member of the chess team, not a football player. He never got a real taste for what sports are like at the school.
"I know that hitting puts you in the lineup," Schumaker said. "Everybody knows that. That's what makes it difficult when you do come back and don't feel great - trying to find those hits. Because the more you hit, the more you'll find your name in there. That's just the reality of the game."
Fred Rozell, retail pricing director at Oil Price Information Service, said "it's too early to tell" whether surging energy prices will force motorists to buy less fuel.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the fact that he failed to measure up in his just-ended campaign, which drew a level of media attention far out of proportion to his performance.

In September 2008, after noticing a lack of local online resources, Laura Beck enlisted a few friends to help her launch a San Francisco vegan lifestyle blog. In less than two years Vegansaurus.com, now one of the most popular Bay Area vegan sites, has grown to include eight regular bloggers and many guest posters covering vegan news, vegan restaurant and product reviews and vegan recipes. It wasn't long before other Bay Area vegans jumped on the blogging bandwagon.

Income tax payments will pick up as next week's filing deadline approaches, but even were they to reach $9.1 billion for the month and continue as expected for the remaining two months of the fiscal year, the state would still be left with a $4 billion-plus deficit for 2011-12  just about what last year's miracle money would have covered.

Hey, Tony: I like Colt McCoy, but he simply can't win in this division. Maybe he would have fared better if he was in the NFC West or AFC West, but his problem is that he simply does not elevate the play of the guys around him. Look at Big Ben -- worst O-line in the league and he gets the job done at a Pro Bowl level. If McCoy played with the Steelers' O-line he'd be slaughtered. If the Colts want to trade, we have the most ammo to move up. Two firsts this year and one next year should get it done. If Andrew Luck really is the guy then we got to get him. Any thoughts? -- Billy D, Mentor
“We can maintain a friendly competition because that’s where we need everybody’s minds to be – in that position in order for us to get our best foot forward,” he said. “You get everybody in the right mindset to know, ‘When I’m on the field, I’m the best player out there.

D: Directions: Want to be on time for your interview? Map it out ahead of time. Sure, you can use your GPS but be sure it's right. Getting lost on the way doesn't make for casual pre-interview conversation. It only reflects on your lack of preparation and your minor-league professionalism. Once you check in 20 minutes late for an interview, you're in for an uphill battle.

Kelly said the AirTran acquisition will help the company boost revenue to offset the higher fuel costs that are troubling all airlines. Southewest will also look to boost revenue by refining its frequent-flier program and adding larger aircraft.

Henry Abbott: He's one of the very best rebounders in the game, and yet my favorite thing about him is how he throws the lob -- bigs have advantages passing the ball to the rim.

A dilapidated English country house, called Sterne, is the setting for this dark but droll story of strangers seeking refuge after a nearby train accident and refusing to leave. The eccentric family living at Sterne, who are celebrating a birthday, initially welcome and comfort the pale wanderers, but soon find themselves overwhelmed by their demands. No further description of the plot is possible without ruining much of the thrill of the story. I'll only say that I read "The Uninvited Guests" a couple of months ago, and I'm still haunted by it. Ms. Jones's earlier work, "The Outcast," won the Costa Book Awards prize for First Novel.

Realistically, Barack Obama has about six months to turn around the nation's financial plight or prepare for the possibility of looking for another job at 51. Sadder for him will be the comparisons in history he would have to suffer the rest of his life if that occurs, Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter prominent among them. Hoover had no answer to the financial tidal wave that hit the nation. Carter was a victim of his own inexperience and narrow perspectives about the job.

Michigan State guard Brandon Wood never imagined he'd be engaged in conversations like these as he casually watched college basketball games with his roommate.

By late Tuesday, a Bank of America fund established in Lilly's name had grown to $10,265, money that Lilly acknowledges has underwritten some typical teenage desires: a laptop, an iPhone, another tattoo and four new suitcases to hold her worldly possessions. (Two bags were assigned solely to her coveted shoe collection.)
"She has built a tremendous following through the years, not because she was trying to build a tremendous following but just because of the good work that she's been doing," Taylor said. "She's always very curious about what's going on, she always wants to make a positive difference … and, fortunately, she's been continuing on with her work to the benefit of all of us here in town."
It doesn't seem like such a good idea, either, to publicly dismiss one of the country's most powerful political figures - one who isn't play-acting when he waxes nostalgic about a place that once truly felt like home.
Along with a potential 20-year prison term, Castanon faces a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutors said. He also will be required to pay restitution.
One advantage Pangea thinks it has: It pays in cash and does its own property management.
out of money and possibly default on its debt. House Republicans say they won't raise the debt limit without equal spending cuts. President Barack Obama and Democrats have insisted that higher revenues must be included.
Justice Department officials first leveled the allegations against Arpaio in December, saying a culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights prevailed at his office.
Day 4 Recap: Testimony began on June 27. On Thursday, three women told their stories of meeting accused serial killer Anthony Sowell. All three said Sowell was quiet and congenial when they met him, and that he politely offered invitations to his Imperial Avenue home to drink and smoke crack cocaine.
But Portland is known for great coffee too. So from the airport we make a beeline to Helser's, a breakfast spot in the city's northeast quadrant, for caffeine and generous plates of buttermilk pancakes and salmon hash. Thus fortified, we head to our first beer tasting — at the Portland Farmers Market.
The rate of displacement surprised even people with a front-row view.
It lends more emotional power to the Hulk when he's eventually unleashed. And through motion-capture technology in which Ruffalo's body language and performance is digitally captured as the undercarriage for the Hulk, topped off by computer animation, the green giant looks more genuine and moves more credibly among real people than he did in the earlier movies.
The Finnish startup making "Angry Birds" games -- in which players use a slingshot to attack pigs who steal the birds' eggs -- has been valued by analysts at up to $9 billion, just short of that of struggling world No. 2 phonemaker Nokia.
The new criteria make several key changes:
INSIDER NOTES:
He was the first batter of the first World Series game in his first World Series. Whitaker worked the count full, fouling several pitches, then smacked a double to deepest left-center. Trammell came up, singled to left, and within seven minutes, Detroit had a run. It was the 64th time this season the Tigers had scored in the first inning.
Being displaced by a natural disaster is nothing new for sixth-grader Ronisha Taylor. Her family lived in Mississippi when Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, precipitating their move to Minnesota.

Nonetheless, it's serious business to International Paper. It employs 300 people in its cluster of buildings, which include the bag plant, a box plant, an ink and stamp facility that provides the sack designs, and a recycling plant. The company has been there since 1971.
If an earlier vote is an indication, residents such as Meeks are open to paying an extra penny in sales tax — part of the 2012 transportation referendum — if it will mean smoother commutes not just on the highway but on the state roads that carry local motorists.
Also tonight, the board will consider a plan to repurpose the district's 44 vacant buildings, many of which have fallen into disrepair. Adams will propose opening a charter high school in one of the district's unused buildings for the 2012-13 school year.
In "Out to Pasture/The Family Farm," another harvesting machine rides above a city scene of skyscrapers in shadowy blue tones. Again the color in the painting nearly overwhelms the image, but you sense narrative and symbolic aspects to the work. Is the family farm threatened by the city? Does the city in some way support the farm? The possibilities are intriguing.
But the bioscience field, which offers the promise of high-paying jobs, got its biggest boost in 2000 when voters passed Proposition 301, a sales-tax increase that would provide about $1 billion over two decades for scientific research at public universities.
Gen. John Allen, top commander of U.S. and all international forces in Afghanistan, issued a statement Wednesday condemning the photos even before they were published. He said they represented a violation of a policy on the handling of enemy remains that dictates they be treated as humanely as possible.
Hunched over in the tail of the chopper, Arias watches solemnly as Downham unzips Tim’s survival suit, then takes out his knife and cuts the suit at the waist to expose more of his chest. When he does, seawater gushes out. Downham flinches, worried all the saltwater might short-out the helicopter’s electronics. After slicing through Tim’s wet undershirt, and applying several conduction pads to Tim’s chest, Downham tries to shock the fisherman back to life, twice.
"I don't worry about their hurt feelings. Sometimes, that's a good thing. Kids rebound a whole lot better than coaches," Samuel said on the weekly OVC teleconference.
Kroger could have been re-elected -- possibly without opposition -- had he run again. Nobody doubts that he has the intellect and energy to be a formidable college president.
Meanwhile, Residence XXV units, the condominiums above The Ritz-Carlton Hotel at 18th and Curtis streets, have been listed at prices 45 percent to 60 percent the original asking prices since developers Craft DeLay bought the project out of receivership in June.
Tebow, though, represented a glimmer of hope, not just to the Hitchlers but to scores of other Denver fans who wore their No. 15 jerseys to the stadium Sunday.
If Zimmerman was the aggressor and provoked the fight, that might be manslaughter, said Orlando defense attorney Diana Tennis.
For Pitt, the big sci-fi thriller also represents his strongest bid to have a big film franchise of his own, which might be viewed as the missing piece of his career jigsaw puzzle. Forster and Paramount Pictures each view "World War Z" as a trilogy that would have the grounded, gun-metal realism of, say, Damon's Jason Bourne series tethered to the unsettling end-times vibe of AMC's "The Walking Dead."
She asks for explanations. How could two branches of evolution independently produce essentially the same complex design for an eye.

Del. Heather R. Mizeur, a Montgomery County Democrat, said she's prepared to introduce legislation to address the concerns of landowners and real estate agents. "There's no reason why Wall Street investors should have more information about the riskiness of this practice in order to protect their financial investment in the company," Mizeur said. "Why should that outweigh the impacts on landowners who are engaging in these leasing practices?"
The spill occurred in 2009 when a tank on the ship Dubai Star began overflowing during refueling between San Francisco and Alameda. Investigators say among other errors, the crew waited hours before calling cleanup companies.
Walker's spokesman, Tom Evenson, said the primary's outcome "changes nothing."
Check the origins. By no means will this guarantee great Champagne, but you can find cells of greatness in many grand cru villages (Champagne is ranked by the price of grapes each village can potentially command). Towns like Ambonnay, Ay and Bouzy (for Pinot Noir) or Cramant, Le-Mesnil-sur-Oger and Avize (for Chardonnay) have a preponderance of great vineyard sites, harnessed by local producers. So check the address.
A strong argument can be made that healthier children are more ready to learn. Healthy children also have fewer school absences, are more engaged in their studies and quite possibly will behave better. Now, what educator would work against that outcome?
Although Albert Pujols was hitless in four at-bats, he drove in a run with a third-inning grounder, ending at 14 a string of games without a run batted in and giving him five RBIs this season.
The Wildcats won their eighth title in school history just over a week ago. Kentucky freshmen Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marquis Teague and sophomores Doron Lamb and Terrence Jones have until April 29 to decide whether to enter the NBA draft.
The Longhorns also downed Santa Teresa 5-2 with Hogan again throwing a complete game. She struck out six and allowed only two hits and two unearned runs.

The president recommended trimming the growth of Medicare spending, cuts in defense, an overhaul of the tax system to eliminate many loopholes enjoyed by individuals and corporations, and an end to Bush-era tax cuts for wealthier Americans.
This time around, the three councilors at Monday's meeting agreed that a $750 monthly stipend, with insurance, computer and cell phone, would be more appropriate. They suggested the mayor receive reimbursement for mileage rather than a car allowance. The changes, if approved, would take effect at the start of 2013.
As Coughlin suggested, there’s yet to be a team on its way to the Super Bowl that isn’t talking about “harmony” among the ranks.
Kapilow writes for the orchestra with undeniable flair, and there are passages in "Chrysopylae" that boast a certain rhythmic exuberance - particularly in the finale, when the chorus bursts into a celebratory passage around the phrase "seventy-five years." And the inclusion of the recorded sounds, which could so easily sound gimmicky, is smoothly integrated into the score.
"The Fighter" was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress (for both Adams and Leo). In January, Bale won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.
"As an industry, salaries peaked about 10 years ago, and people had to get used to that realization," Salamone said. "It was a recipe for change."
Since its opening in October 2007, Cinghiale has been in a state of change.
"It was thrilling but it stinks to lose your last regular season game," Nerinx Hall Coach Jody Patterson said. "Anybody in the top six seeds is able to win that is why it is so exciting now in St. Louis for all girls lacrosse."
OGDENSBURG — The thief who stole $400,000 in gold nuggets from a Sussex County mining museum last month probably melted down the precious stones, making their recovery unlikely, Ogdensburg Police Chief Bill Varcadipane said today.
The investigation is ongoing, and a motive was not known, Mata said.
Still wondering.

Nevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and financial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy.
In the end, the Raiders got two players who take their football very seriously and have good track records at a fraction of a cost that would have taken to retain Wimbley, who nonetheless got $6 million of Oakland's money and was due for another $17.5 million guaranteed had he remained on the roster.
Defense attorneys also could ask for the conviction to be overturned because Perry let jurors hear a good deal of evidence that portrayed Anthony as a party girl who went out dancing while her daughter was missing and got a tattoo that says "Bella Vita."
"This is exciting," said Ann Sindelar, a reference supervisor at the research research center, about 10:15 a.m. "We had people in here at right at 9, and to tell you the truth, some of the images are still loading."
I can't believe the entire Jets roster hasn't sprained their chests, puffing them out as far as they do.
The findings of the two surveys used different methodology and definitions -- and did not necessarily include all of the same veterans. The veterans group surveyed only veterans. The government survey, which is based on annual averages, included all Americans in the work force.
Wait, here’s an idea: Put it all on one foul shot, make or miss. If you hit the free throw, you get to do whatever your heart desires — even fire coach Stan Van Gundy, and hire Shamu from Seaworld.
High rainfall combined with high tide are the main reasons for the water level, which is highest between mileposts 23 and 25.
Carniceria Guanajuato's authenticity is clear. The voice on the PA system speaks Spanish, and aisles are stocked with plenty of unfamiliar -- at least to me -- produce and products. Even the meat counter displays cuts, such as tripe, tongue and pig's trotters, that I don't usually see at my regular store.
On Monday, a colleague stopped by who'd seen "Angels in America." He wanted to talk about Larry Yando's performance as Roy Cohn in the epic drama by Tony Kushner, now playing at the Court Theatre.

Avril and teammates such as Kyle Vanden Bosch and Dominic Raiola worked out with Kielbaso during last year's NFL lockout. Vanden Bosch is a notorious workout fiend who would coax the crew at Total Performance to let him in before business hours.
Seismic intrusions of granite welled upward in California and built up the Sierra range that began rising some 40 million to 60 million years ago, according to Hammond's history of the mountains.
“The problem is that it’s difficult to educate members of the community,” said Environmental Commission Chairman Nelson Dittmar.
At 24, Lacretia Bolden believes her big selling point with voters is her youth.

Dawn Phipps, a 58-year-old mother of three from Boise, says she's outraged Winder's initiative is happening in Idaho, calling it demeaning and shameful to women.
* A quick note on my philosophy of voting, which I've been explaining for a few years now. I try to vote almost entirely on onfield performance, ignoring my preseason poll and the reputations of the teams. It's pretty simple. Let what happens on the field dictate my rankings. This can make my rankings very volatile from week to week, especially early in the year. In the end, I think this is what most voters end up doing anyway, but for the first month, my ballot can look odd at times.

Kipnis hit a 1-0 pitch from Hisanori Takahashi between first and second base to give the Indians their 11th home win in their last at-bat and break a four-game losing streak.
After several rounds of balloting, it is Piccoli's Cardinal Melville, so unassuming a figure that we hardly notice him in the early processions, who gets the nod. He will be the "incarnation of God on Earth."
In late 2008, French Senator Jean-Pierre Fourcade used a closed-door gathering of center-right lawmakers around Mr. Sarkozy to voice concerns that France's budget deficit and debt risked spiraling out of control. His words carried weight given that Mr. Fourcade is the last French finance minister to have presided over a balanced budget surplus, in 1974.
"You could haul a lot of groceries in that," he said helpfully. "Do you want to take it for a spin on the parking lot?"
But Brett Smith of the Center for Automotive Research Center in Ann Arbor says that sometimes it's cheaper.
Caldwell said that after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami last week, Curry County's reverse 9-1-1 system -- which authorities wanted to use to warn residents to stay away from the ocean -- failed because of a glitch. He said Curry County has not been able to put as much of its own local money into 9-1-1 as most other counties in the state.
How much of Aqua's substantial appeal, if any, has to do with Gang's gender? Certainly its shape is animated by characteristics that -- at the risk of slipping into stereotype -- we associate with femininity and even the female form. But then so does Gehry's Beekman Tower, which appears loosely draped in a fabric-like skin. Perhaps more to the point, Aqua seems impatient with the rigidly geometric and overly muscled shapes that surround it in the Chicago skyline as well as with the race to achieve height at the expense of architectural expression.
"These are the memories we use to develop a sense of identity -- who we are and where we come from," said study author Carole Peterson, a professor of psychology at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada.
He said that has helped investigators assemble a timeline of events in the cages, but he would not provide any details.
Starting in the 1970s, Bravo owned a succession of San Vicente Boulevard salons that catered to a different clientele: the Westside elite. Political movers and shakers, venture capitalists and film honchos shelled out $100 or more for a cut and styling. Today, the Dreamer is much more likely to take payment in apples or oranges, or a ball made of rubber bands.
The three-time All-Star plans to meet with Roberts Wednesday morning after the team returns to Portland from its three-game trip, and the two will decide if further medical tests are needed.
The older generation on the roster is represented by bluesman B.B. King (Nov. 20), bandleader and trumpeter Doc Severinsen (April 18) and pianist Menahem Pressler (Sept. 7) -- all in their 80s.

Mueller told the panel that "we've seen over the last several days" that terrorism should be "our No. 1 priority."
The players used it. The manager used it. Some wondered, others asserted, whether it was there for the umpires.
Noderer gasps for air as she struggles to answer the dispatcher's questions - the gun is next to him in the bed, it looks like he shot himself in the heart, and he doesn't seem to be breathing, she says.
The Blues spent a big chunk of the third period in the penalty box and failed to muster a comeback. Afterward, coach Ken Hitchcock reminded his team it would have to dig much, much deeper to score against the tight-checking Kings and acrobatic goaltender Jonathan Quick.
Desrosiers spent two years at Wake Forest. He appeared in all 31 games during his time with the Demon Deacons, making 16 starts last season and averaging 4.8 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.9 blocks.
Strickland is the former Democratic governor who last November lost to Kasich.
Orville and Wilbur Wright didn't have a government grant to launch their plane, and, more importantly, they didn't need three dozen permits and an EPA study to take off. They took their risk, not just in terms of dreams and accomplishment, but of treasure and bodily harm, and quite literally took off — without a safety net! But we latter-day Americans demand a safety net. If not on our own, then there is always some busybody willing to put a safety net around a rare, never-heard-of bottom-feeder fish or somebody else's dubious economic interests. The trouble is, safety does not breed invention.
The decision by the rail authority, first reported by The Times on Friday, reflects the lukewarm support the project has received among Republican lawmakers in the county and local transportation officials, including board members of the Orange County Transportation Authority.
“When you play with Kovy you just have to be ready for the puck. He’s a great passer as well as a scorer.”
Commissioners have already tried to relieve the burden a bit, by approving small yearly discounts as the tax was phased in. The discount was 20 percent in the first year, 10 percent in the second year, and 5 percent in 2011.
"I don't know if half of these people understood what they're doing," Hernandez said.
Yet, the fighter who was slow to pull the trigger and move during those recent losses could very well also be fighting for the final time, ending a celebrated career that included two victories over Oscar De La Hoya and a stirring Staples Center triumph over Antonio Margarito in 2009.
Revenue in restaurants open at least one year, a key measure of a restaurant chains financial health, rose 2 percent domestically and 4.7 percent abroad.
5. Castle Lake, Trinity-Divide: This adventure has world-class views and is easy to reach off I-5, but gets missed by thousands. Castle Lake Road is directly west of Mount Shasta and rises up from Lake Siskiyou into the Trinity-Divide. The road has been plowed this week to Castle Lake, but by mid-winter, it is usually blocked by snow about a mile from the lake. This is one of the best viewpoints to the east, where giant Shasta pokes a hole into the sky like a giant diamond. You can snowshoe about a mile with a slight, easy grade to Castle Lake, elevation 5,450 feet. At the lake, you can get ambitious, find a route to the left and trek above the lake for another jaw-dropping view.

Mail-order companies like Express Scripts and Medco have also chipped away at Standard Drug's pharmacy business because those companies make employees of companies they have agreements with pay steep prices at any retail location for drugs whether they're part of a company's formulary or not.
Evidently, some industry insiders think the solution to the problem of dwindling ticket sales is to let moviegoers be more distracted -- and distracting. Specifically, they have mulled allowing some cellphone use -- presumably texting, not talking -- to provide a more appealing environment for teens and young adults.
Sullivan pointed out that in this particular region of present-day China, near North Korea, the climate would have been relatively cooler than in surrounding areas. The average temperature where Y. huali roamed was about 50 degrees, compared with 64 degrees elsewhere, so a downy coat could have come in handy.
One chapter in particular resonates with Fickell. Dedicated to "The Man of Action," it is based on Union Lt. Col. Joshua Chamberlain's defense of a hill called Little Round Top in the Battle of Gettysburg. In the decisive action of the pivotal battle of the Civil War, Chamberlain, a former Maine schoolteacher, led a bayonet charge down the hill, repulsing a Confederate advance and keeping the Union forces from being flanked. "Many people move out of the way for a person on the run," Andrews argues. "Others are caught up in his wake."
Which is what a lot of us have been wanting for quite some time.
"The Coast guard really appreciates mariners that go above and beyond to help out other people on the water," Swanson said. "We really commend his service."
And unlike many rich people who dabble in Hollywood, Soon-Shiong has no opinion on the content Fourth Wall makes. "I have very little knowledge of media, so I don't know whether what they are making is good or bad," he said with a laugh. "My modus operandi is to attack a problem in a way nobody ever has before and be confident that if we're successful, the revenue will come."

After Deen's announcement of her diagnosis, Bourdain bashed her for hawking fatty foods and then "selling the cure."
The Sterling Vintner's Collection Chardonnay is a medium-bodied, bigger white than the pinot grigio. It's also more complex, partially due to oak aging, which lends vanilla flavoring to the wine. It's a well-balanced wine, meaning that peach and stone fruit flavors are not overwhelmed by the oak. Although I preferred the pinot grigio with my fish dinner, another diner, who got drafted into our tasting, thought the chardonnay was a better match.
In February 2010, Elgin taxi driver Amilkar Caro gunned down a 28-year-old hotel chef who Caro believed was courting his ex-girlfriend, according to police and court records.

He came through the Prudential Center for the last time Wednesday night, with 300 family and friends and foundation kids rooting for him. He’s an L.A. guy now — married to his college girlfriend, with two daughters — and doesn’t come back often other than to run a one-week summer camp near Barringer.
THE FATIGUE FACTOR
The payoff should be worth it, though, Holden mused. The huge crowd and connection to other vendors could be a pathway into the Portland food world. She is confident in her luxurious flavors, such as her "most decadent" vanilla caramel with Tahitian vanilla and a salted caramel she contends is one of the best at the show.
On April 30, Sabatino De Santis Jr., sent out a press release on behalf of the bankrupt Lebanon Township First Aid Squad saying that as of April 19, the township was being served by neighboring emergency services agencies.
THE UGLY
Standing outside the meeting, Barbara Keshishian, president of the NJEA, declined to comment, saying the meeting was private. Leaders of the other unions have not responded to a request for comment, but three union and legislative sources said they discussed proposals by Gov. Chris Christie and Sweeney to change health benefits for state employees. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the meeting.
And yet unremarkable was just what these patients needed. The residents of this care center, after all, are largely there because they have no other choice. They are recovering from surgery and illness and have nowhere else to go. Some are homeless.
"Monet and Seurat are both impressionists, and impressionism has the immediate appeal of color and light," Kelly said. "They are products of their times and the fashions of their times, but they have a meditative quality that transcends the moment in which they were created."

On other days, they will be able to design a house of twigs or make a sculpture of leaves.
But Watson was looking to the sky at a helicopter, the possibilities churning along with its propellers. Could someone land that behind the Live Oak tree and pick him up? And wasn’t Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 winner standing next to him at the jacket ceremony, a pilot?
Carrasco is in the final season of his two-year, $2.4 million contract.
The reports always have been available to the public in paper form. But the health department only received about 100 requests from the general public to see the records each year, said Commissioner Willie Bess.

The king of the road has abdicated once and for all.
Blair Beed, a lifelong Haligonian (that's what Halifax people call themselves) who has been guiding visitors for 39 years, ushered me into his car at 9 a.m. Then he let loose a torrent of Titanic facts.
These days, some critics of tenure say it is an outmoded concept, more appropriate to a university setting where it is earned over years, granted more sparingly and serves to protect academic freedom. Teachers unions counter that it is key to protecting instructors from incompetent or vindictive administrators, some of whom have never taught.
The first two deaths, however, involved professionals. Two watermen were killed during the opening weeks of the year in unusual accidents. Samuel Todd fell overboard in Dorchester County's Fishing Bay and although he was rescued, he succumbed to the cold. Richard Quapy died when the fishing boat on which he was riding slammed at high speed into a navigational marker in the Gunpowder River near Aberdeen Proving Grounds.

A dozen European nations and Japan have already been spared from those sanctions after the administration determined they had substantially reduced their Iranian oil imports. India, along with China, South Korea, Turkey and South Africa have still not received such waivers.
Obama's foreign policy has been a great strength. He has rolled back on some of the damage of Bush's two invasions – both incredible failures and the source of nearly 6,000 American combat deaths and more than 44,000 wounded. Voters may be shocked to realize that almost 3 million military personnel fought (and are fighting) in these two conflicts.
Tea Party-backed GOP lawmakers want more. With a Tea Party rally set for Thursday on Capitol Hill, it's unclear how many of the 87 freshmen Republicans elected last fall could live with the arrangement between top Democrats and House Speaker John Boehner, the Ohio Republican.

Calhoun was hailed as the next great Christ the King player when she was moved up to the varsity as a freshman. This year in her sophomore campaign she became that, often carrying the Royals and consistently making the big plays down the stretch. Calhoun, ranked 11th in her class by HoopGurlz, can score in the lane, knock down jumpers, rebound, defend and feed open teammates.

According to the US Census Bureau, the majority of small business owners are non-employed (meaning no employees) and many are selling services from consulting, coaching, design, financial, IT, etc. to other small businesses. The question for these individuals as well as others engaged in business to consumer (B2C) or business to retail (B2R) is how to effectively market and ultimately increase sales.

"The Walking Dead": Fans of the zombie apocalypse-and-the-people-who-survived-it series have been divided about Season 2. After AMC fired showrunner Frank Darabont early in the filming of Season 2, viewers were outraged. The show's budget was reduced, and some fans have griped about too much being spent on one location, a farm that serves as temporary refuge for the hard-pressed survivors.

The one time the story flirts with sentimentality is when Mia is smitten by the spectacle of a white horse chained to a cement block in a junk-strewn lot.

A: I really like some of the older ones, even if they came out before I was born. My favorites are Wizard of Oz by Jersey Jack Pinball and probably the newest one by Stern, called AC/DC. It has 12 AC/DC songs and little mechanical toys of all of the band members moving around and dancing. When you push the start button, you pick which of the 12 songs you want to hear. I pick "Thunderstruck" pretty often. It's a good, high-tempo song, but it actually soothes me.

Iken's goal is to fill his students' minds with questions. He talks about the word "hero." He opens their eyes to the difference between patriotism and nationalism.

Tears come when he talks about former students who return to thank him, sometimes years later.

Or an old Keaton movie. You feel this way because a Greta Gerwig performance is as naturalistic and free of style as her everyday conversation, and as sprightly and fun to listen to as her name, Greta Gerwig. She is verbose, funny, prone to long, meandering thoughts that end in a self-conscious laugh, a dismissal of everything she has just said. And no — aside from starring in the new indie comedy"Damsels in Distress,"the first movie from director Whit Stillman in 14 years — she doesn't fit that cleanly into anything.

My favorite thing about watching Suggs, however, might be the opportunities he creates for others. He's extremely good at locking up a tight end or a tackle, stringing a play out wide, and forcing a ball carrier to abandon his initial cut. Those plays don't show up in the stats, but that's one of the reasons the Ravens are so good at stopping the run. The string plays out to the sideline, and the guys on the edges who responsible for keeping contain rarely get suckered up the field (and have a runner slip underneath them, and they rarely get hook blocked. Suggs does this as well as anyone in football. And he still rushes the passer incredibly well.

Schiano: Joe was, has been a ton, everything to me. He gave me a chance. I was a 25-year-old kid, and he gave me a chance, hired me as a full-time coach at one of the top programs in the country. He certainly gave my career a jumpstart to say the least, and I learned a ton working under him for six years and he's been a mentor of mine.

I know it's a very keen subject right now, but I just feel better staying on our (game). I'll be rooting for coach Paterno. Hopefully he has a great end to these next couple of weeks.

But the more challenging maze for Whicher consisted in the emotional relations among the Kent family members. Summerscale slowly unfolds her story with the skill of an Agatha Christie or a P.D. James (and in the author's acknowledgments, James is thanked for her help). Despite its intense privacy, the Kent family revealed itself, under Whicher's investigation, to be profoundly unhappy. The great source of tension was Samuel Kent's remarriage, after his first wife's death, to the family governess, Mary Pratt. The children of the second marriage were favored over the children of the first, and Whicher turned his "air of keen observation" on Constance, one of Kent's older daughters, for two very slight reasons: her reportedly cool demeanor right after the murder and a missing nightdress.

Two women from the food working group appealed to supporters to help secure a commercial kitchen before winter. Currently, food pours into Zuccotti Park via donations, pizza deliveries and dishes cooked in various home kitchens and carried in, a system that doesn't guarantee hot meals and that is becoming unwieldy as the numbers being fed — more than 2,000 daily — increase.

Last year, when SLUH watched all that talent graduate, the Junior Billikens were once again good but not great by their standards. SLUH took fourth at the 2010 tournament as DeSmet won the state title. Most programs would be happy if not overjoyed by a fourth-place finish. It was a bitter pill for the juniors and seniors on that team to swallow. They were devastated they hadn't lived up to the tradition. That they had, in some way, let the program down by not winning the championship.

AWe love being a mutual company. It's a great business model because the people who own our policies also own the company. There are no outside shareholders, so there is no conflict between doing what is best for our policy owners and doing what is best for Wall Street. I tell people we are really like a giant co-op. Yes, most of our capital needs to be internally generated from our operations, but that hasn't limited us. Despite the turmoil of the past several years, for example, our total surplus capital is more than $18 billion, the highest in our history.

Director Anthony J. Haney coaxes intensity from the cast, but the complex, intertwined plot threads remain muddled, as the fate of the soldiers, natives and officers unfold.

"A Gifted Man": The first episode of this ethereal drama is different enough to be make the series worth taking a chance on.

The source of bones: The Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

Lamb lovers willing to spare no expense will immediately reach for the loin lamb chops, which produce a succulent dish. But those little beauties can carry a stiff price tag. Here we use lamb shoulder chops or round bone chops cut from the leg; they're not as buttery tender, but they are full of flavor -- and if cooked to medium-rare doneness, they are still succulent.

Young women, for instance, were the subjects in the famous (to us, anyway) "beer goggles" study. It found that the more young women drink, the worse they are at detecting facial symmetry.

Another GOP mega donor who contributed to the Romney super PAC in January was Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons, who gave $8.6 million to Republican super PACs last year.

Simmons also gave $5 million last month to American Crossroads, a Republican group formed in part by Karl Rove, building upon the $7 million he and his company donated to the super PAC in 2011.

"When we came back we were incredibly inspired and ready to change the world," Loomis says, laughing a little at herself. "We realized we love to cook, and we want to inspire other people. We thought about doing a cafe, but then we realized there's not a lot of farm-fresh food on-the-go."
Under the bill, the Kansas City plan could be used in other parts of the state where districts became unaccredited, except in St. Louis, where city families would meet with an independent clearinghouse to determine the best option.
Blues C Andy McDonald. He was terrific in the first round victory against the Sharks. His eight points are third-best through one round, and he had a role in all four Game 3 goals. Offense is hard to come by for St. Louis, so he’ll have to marvel again to get past Los Angeles.
Rich Lober, 50, a lifelong Dayton resident, said Mexican and other immigrants have helped East Third.

The 2011-12 budget assumed revenues that everyone knew at the time were most likely falsely optimistic  and that's proved to be the case. The 2012-13 budget now being formulated will assume that voters pass Gov. Jerry Brown's tax package in November, and he's hinging passage on the false assertion that it will give a big boost to schools.
The move follows an early stumble at Disney's first big foray into standalone resorts: Aulani, the roughly $850 million hotel and time share that opened Aug. 29 on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Disney was forced to suspend sales in the project for two months this summer after it realized it had underestimated the annual fees needed to cover the resort's operating costs; Disney will now have to subsidize the fees paid by early time-share buyers for the next 50 years.

The Miami Heat is much more difficult to write off, but in the end, I can't see James sharing the ball/spotlight/credit with Dwyane Wade and, to a lesser extent, Chris Bosh. No matter how much James contributes, the Heat always will be Wade's team. Batman and Robin works in the NBA; Batman-Batman-Robin is a tricky proposition.

Saffold's daughter attended the same high school as my daughter; I was her softball coach in the late 1990s. My heart sank at this news. We don't know if she's the real culprit behind the comments, which included references to two death-penalty cases in Saffold's courtroom. We do know her mother was willing to let her take the blame.

The recommended reductions come as the district copes with an expected $9.5 million shortfall -- nearly 10 percent of its budget -- heading into the 2011-12 school year. But even if every item on the line-by-line list handed out Wednesday went to the chopping block, that would still only save the district just under $9.3 million.

Doyle on the debt ceiling: Beaverton Mayor Denny Doyle weighs in on the debt-ceiling debate, in this guest column on The Stump urging caution before before cutting benefits for seniors. Doyle writes: "Congress is considering a provision to enact a co-payment for seniors who require home health care services. Essentially, this is a tax increase on seniors. It would take more money out of the pockets of senior home-health patients, of which three out of five live below the poverty line."
According to a poll published earlier this year by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 86% of unmarried people ages 18 to 29 are sexually active. And though it may not be surprising that 87% of the same group reported that they are not ready to have kids — including 88% of women and 86% of men — their actions don't always line up with their intentions.
So recently I headed to Yosemite National Park and the Ansel Adams Gallery, which offers free camera walks, as well as photo classes and multi-day workshops for a fee, taught by staff photographers. Many of the iconic Yosemite photos I adore were shot by Adams, who died in 1984, and I thought a lesson here would be the nearest thing to learning from the man himself.

Noticeably missing among those we saw were representatives of St. Louis' theater and arts scenes. We didn't see anybody from Grand Center, the Rep, the Black Rep, the Muny or the Regional Arts Commission. Granted, there was competition with the St. Louis Symphony Red Velvet gala, which was underway at Powell Symphony Hall. Perhaps it was just too busy a night for people to be everywhere at once in The Lou.

Prices are already easing at U.S. gas stations. The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded fell to $3.907 on Thursday, down nearly 3 cents from a week ago, according to AAA. Prices generally climb in the spring in anticipation of more driving during warm weather, but this year the climb started earlier—mid-December—because of concerns over Iranian oil supplies and the closing of a number of money-losing East Coast refineries.

As much as any of her songs, Ain't No Way is a shining example of the spectacle that is Aretha Franklin's voice, which conveys an extraordinary range of emotions for more than four minutes. She begins in a state of simmering resignation and slowly ignites into a visceral and naked expression of defiance, exasperation and despair. It's a spine-tingling display of power and elegance, as operatic as much as anything.

Look in the headlines today for other examples of teams counting on their own first-round picks for production. Stephen Strasburg (1st overall) makes his return today to the Washington Nationals from Tommy John surgery. Justin Upton (1st overall) has been a key part of Arizona's shocking run to the NL West lead. The absence of Buster Posey (5th overall) has been a key reason why San Francisco was vulnerable in the NL West. Just this past weekend, the Cardinals got an eyeful of Yonder Alonso (7th overall), the Cincinnati Reds' prospect who is playing left field just to get his bat in the lineup.
Godbee said the department has about 240 reserve officers, but the goal is to recruit 200-250 more.
But that personality has also surfaced on the court since Mills entered the rotation.

Andy Dirks had a single, double and drove in three runs in his first two at-bats, helping give Verlander (3-1) a 5-0 lead.
The enigma that is Jay Gatsby has been one of the reasons there has never been a satisfactory screen adaptation of Fitzgerald's 1925 masterpiece: The impenetrable murkiness of Gatsby's character handily defies cinematic shorthand. But, like Draper, Gatsby's elusiveness is much more than a literary convenience. Fitzgerald, the Midwesterner who went East to reinvent himself, saw both sides of the American "dream." On the one hand, ours has always been a culture of hope and aspiration. On the other, our abiding belief in change and the ability to reinvent ourselves can bring us perilously close to the edge of self-delusion.
Ford is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail.
The bill allows state colleges and universities the option of setting lower rates for students who don't qualify for in-state tuition because they moved away before graduation.

Rod didn't really want a bunch of billionaires to pony up cash to fund a nonprofit group in exchange for appointing Valerie Jarrett to the Senate seat. He was just talking about it. And the fact that he stopped talking about the scheme after Jarrett withdrew her name means nothing. He just has attention deficit disorder or something. He quickly moved along, and so should we. There's really nothing to see here.
The heftiest portion of the bond — about $1.5 million — will be put toward site work at Meredith Farms, a shuttered poultry processing plant that has been deemed a redevelopment site.
Who would have thought Pat Casey and his guys would be sitting in first place when we're 2/3 of the way through the season? Not many people, that's for sure. Though from the beginning, players and coaches said they were going to be better than everyone was giving them credit for. A few weeks ago in the dugout, Andrew Susac smiled and said, "I told you so! I told you before our first game we were going to be good. Now do you believe me?"
As usual, the telephone rang at a bad time, when I was crawling around the floor trying to find a missing thumb drive.

Right now, the Beavers are 3 ½ games behind the Ducks in the standings. Oregon has just one conference series (at home against USC) before the Civil War; OSU has two (at Utah and at Washington State).

If you’re looking for Jagger wearing his Rolling Stone colors that’s easiest to hear on the song “Never Gonna Change” co-written with Stewart. It has the same country rock ballad vibe as “Wild Horses.” The current single from the record “Miracle Worker” is a gritty reggae piece, but even better is the bright ’n’ breezy reggae of “Beautiful People” that places Stone in lead vocal position with Jagger and Marley testing their upper registers with backup.

"Knox served honorably through 30 years of public service and his honest mistake in starting a new position 16 days too soon should not result in the catastrophic result that Treasury demands of him," the panel — made up of Philip Carchman, Clarkson Fisher and Linda Baxter — said in a 21-page decision.

"Leap of Faith," the musical version of the 1992 film in which Steve Martin played a crooked evangelist who has a crisis of faithlessness, is as slick as ice on Teflon. To be sure, Raúl Esparza, the hardworking star, is smooth in the wrong way—he comes across like a talk-show host, not a sequin-spangled faith healer—and none of the other members of the immensely likable cast give the impression of having traveled much farther west than Chelsea. But if you're looking for pure Broadway razzmatazz, "Leap of Faith" delivers the goods. Robin Wagner's set turns the interior of the St. James Theatre into a revival tent, and Christopher Ashley and Sergio Trujillo, the director and choreographer, put every square inch of it to effective use. The chorus rocks and rolls. The gospel-style songs, by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater, are rousingly lively (though the ballads, as usual with Mr. Menken, sound like '70s sitcom themes).

Perhaps China's loss of poise is temporary. Perhaps its leaders are playing to nationalist galleries at home because socialism no longer stirs popular emotions. (But that is a dangerous game; they may be hard-pressed to de-escalate future crises of a more serious nature.) Who knows? What is clear is that Beijing's over-the-top reaction to what were ultimately trivial disputes that could have been defused calmly has its neighbors concerned.

Springsteen took a risk coming to South By Southwest this year. What did a classic rocker have to say to the newest generation of music aficionados anyway? Perhaps he knew that those aficionados have been raised on albums by Arcade Fire, the Hold Steady, Okkervil River, and other alternative rock bands who owe as much to the Boss as the Boss owes to Eric Burdon and Woody Guthrie. Tonight they proudly displayed their familiarity with Springsteen's entire discography, singing along to material old and new, shouting for new saxophonist Jake Clemons and cheering the memory of his uncle Clarence, and falling to a reverent hush during the ballads and acoustic breakdowns. The release of "Wrecking Ball" turned the middle of the floor into something not too far from a mosh pit.
A: Of course, I can't give away any punch lines, but I will be talking about a lot of backstage stuff, things I'm not supposed to say.

Most vacancies arise from the predictable event of a judge taking senior status or retiring between the ages of 65 and 70. Under senior status, the judge continues to work, often at a reduced work rate, and the president may nominate someone to fill the vacancy. We are encouraged to give advance notice of our intention to retire or take senior status so that the replacement process can begin. If a judge gives one year's notice of his or her intention to retire or take senior status, the president and the Senate should commit to fill that vacancy within a year, or 16 months at the outside. The same timetable should apply if the vacancy arises in some other manner, such as death, disability or elevation to a higher court. I suggest something like seven to nine months for the president to make a nomination, three to five months for the Senate Judiciary Committee to give the nominee a hearing and an up or down vote, and two months for the full Senate to give an up or down vote on any nominee who clears the Senate Judiciary Committee.

This leads to a scientists' competition in London, which is only slightly less deadly than that of the pirates. It also puts them in the path of Her Majesty (Imelda Staunton), who has her own interest in the captain's pet.
Spinks rebounded, he said, after realizing his dream to run for elected office as a conservative Republican critical of politicians who "by virtue of their wealth and society, are often disconnected from 'Main Street.' "

Orioles manager Buck Showalter has seen a maturation and seriousness in the passionate and outspoken Jones over the past two years that makes him believe the center fielder has embraced — and will continue to embrace — a leadership role.
I'd be in Fenway Park for the 1948 Indians playoff game. I'd want to spend one day feeling the way Lou Boudreau did all year.
They said 11 of the sexual assaults are connected via DNA evidence gathered from rape kits taken from the victims. In the remaining ones, the attacker's actions are so similar that they believe it is likely the work of the same person, who is described as a Latino man in his 40 to 50s who speaks fluent Spanish and English.
Hynoski. Not only did he stone Spikes for much of the game, he pounced on Nicks’ fumble in the third quarter. What was most impressive was where he was when Nicks caught the ball -- at the line of scrimmage after getting a piece of LB Jerod Mayo, whom he thought might be blitzing. Good hustle by Mayo to get to Nicks, but great hustle by Hynoski to be in position to recover the fumble. Too many times you’ll see a guy quit on the play. He didn’t, and he’s to be lauded for that.
Today, for the first time since April 24, the Nuggets practiced at Pepsi Center. After a week away (and a film session Wednesday), the Nuggets regrouped in preparation for Game 3 on Friday.

McClain, 15, said she would enjoy the recognition somewhere down the line. But for now, she’s content to have spent a week with the best of the area and two surfing heroes — which she equated to having a local All-Star team shagging flies with Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez.
Obama also criticized Senate Republicans for voting this week to block the Buffett Rule, a plan to raise the tax rate on millionaires and billionaires such as Warren Buffett, the prominent investor who has noted that his secretary pays more in taxes than he does.

Were "Call Your Girlfriend" to be re-recorded by a male singer (as it surely will be, if it hasn’t already), it would be a very powerful message sent to a man grappling with his sexuality. That was probably on Robyn’s mind when she wrote it, and possibly when she sings it, too. She keeps her voice heavy with ambivalence and concern; she’d like you to believe that she’s telling this story from hard experience, and that she’s been on the losing end of these dance-floor negotiations.

Readers meet Perkus through the eyes of a narrator, the guileless Chase Insteadman, a former child television star still trading on vapid adolescent charisma. His blitheness is so total that he forgets the outlines of his own life story. (Much like, to deep frustration, Perkus can never remember whether Brando is dead.)

In the end, maybe the rash of misfortune and injury coming out of camp is a good thing for ASU football. Remember how some players openly spoke of winning it all? Maybe this lowers the volume and expectations just enough to keep this team from suffocating.
Despite the skepticism, after re-reading the draft-guide scouting reports on McClellin, I felt a regret similar to when I look back at the form to see what I missed in the winning horse I failed to consider, let alone put $2 on. Without having seen McClellin even in shorts as a Bear, I'll say this: McClellin is closer to Brian Urlacher than he is to Dan Bazuin. His versatility, size and athleticism make him a better candidate to succeed somewhere on the Bears' defense. When Bazuin failed at defensive end he had nowhere to go. McClellin has options.
And following a whole fall on the edge, including a surge from 10 1/2 games down in the wild-card race, Tony La Russa's team didn't dare mess with Texas, or any more drama in baseball's first World Series Game 7 since the Angels beat Giants in 2002.
Obama administration officials have been trying to choose between this Colorado rule and a legally-buttressed national rule, which bans most roads on 4.4 million of the 14.5 million acres of national forest in Colorado.

The contract would mark a substantial boost for the aircraft, orders for which lag behind those for the rival Airbus A320neo. The order by Air Lease, created in 2010 by industry veteran Steven Udvar-Házy, highlights the growing importance of aircraft lessors, which are expected to account for more than half of the sales of both models.
And just in time. After serving as a councilman in Florissant for 32 years, Schneider ran for mayor of and won last year, beating five opponents. Whereas he used to play about 27 holes a week, his increased workload as mayor means that Schneider feels lucky to work in nine holes every other week. But he hoped that his golf adventure could inspire others to follow his lead.

A rockabilly musical set in the 1950s, this breezy show is a little like "Grease," which New Line staged a few years ago in characteristically raw style. "Cry-Baby" is even cruder, but it still tells the story of a good girl, Allison (the delightful New Line regular Taylor Pietz), and a bad boy, Cry-Baby. (Welcome newcomer Ryan Foizey, a tall, lean and rough-around-the-edges actor, fits right in to director Scott Miller's offbeat troupe.)

In Los Angeles, where it seems every architecturally significant modernist house has been documented, studied, photographed and published several times over, the 1958 Pasinetti residence has proved to be that rare surprise: a little known midcentury gem that intrigues visitors not just because of the design, but also because of the man who built it -- not Neutra, not Schindler, not Ain, but Georgescu.

"I think ‘organized chaos' would be a better term," Hitchcock said. "This is why the players play. This is what happens when you have a lot of young players in the league. It's very emotional, and it's very intense. It is chaos, but it's still organized.

Spinach: Its powerful ingredients include magnesium, a nutrient most of us don't get enough of. The trouble with that? Makes you feel wimpy, because your muscles (not to mention your heart and intestines) need it to function properly. Your brain loves this green, too: People who eat three or more servings per day (1 cup raw leafy spinach , 1/2 cup chopped raw, or 1/2 cup cooked) of the stuff slow mental decline due to aging by as much as 40 percent. Other leafy greens that help here: kale and collards.

And "Smash" is artistically ambitious, presenting an array of characters that range from plucky and talented to likable and talented to kind-of-a-jerk-but-talented. But it's on NBC, not HBO, Showtime or Starz. In other words, the network is gambling that viewers who don't pay extra for premium cable are -- gasp! -- intelligent enough to want to watch something that's not utterly formulaic, or so familiar you can practically recite the dialogue along with the characters.

Trickier still is the question of how a widow with a skimpy acting résumé and a son who seemed groomed for a career in politics can be qualified to pass the torch to a new theatrical generation.

Steven Rosso, a St. Paul collections attorney, said in many cases the only information creditors have is an outdated credit file.

Finally, technology is a key and confounding factor in men's home and work lives. While it appears responsible for allowing men to get more accomplished in their work lives while keeping up with homefront needs, it has clearly blurred the boundaries between the two, with a resulting increase in tension.

The flaw in the McCain plan, then, is not your central complaint, Dan -- that government is doing something at all -- but rather the plan's specifics. In fact, many of your critiques can be addressed -- McCain could narrow the scope to only owner-occupied primary homes, which would cut out speculators who bought five condos. The plan should also require borrowers who receive assistance to give back something in return. In exchange for a fixed-rate mortgage on terms the individual can afford today, any future increase in property value should be shared with the taxpayers at sale or refinancing (a proposal my colleague Andrew Jakabovics and I outlined early this year).

RAMS RUN OFFENSE VS RAVENS RUN DEFENSE: Whether Steven Jackson plays or not — and he's expected to be a game-time decision — it's hard to foresee the Rams' getting too much going on the ground. The Ravens have shut down the Pittsburgh Steelers' Rashard Mendenhall and the Titans' Chris Johnson, allowing an average of 70 rushing yards, the fourth-lowest total in the NFL. They've also had a top-five rushing defense for five straight seasons. Jackson, who is dealing with a quadriceps injury, rushed for a 47-yard touchdown on the Rams' first offensive play of the season. Since, St. Louis' running game has accrued 166 yards on 44 carries. Cadillac Williams and Jerious Norwood would carry the load if Jackson were out. Williams had 91 yards on 19 carries Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles, but wasn't a factor Monday against the New York Giants. Ravens inside linebacker Ray Lewis, second on the team with 15 tackles, has averaged 13.5 tackles in four career games versus the Rams.

--CF Austin Jackson had four hits for the third time this season, making himself and SS Harvey Kuenn the only Detroit players since at least 1918 to have at least that many hits in the Tigers' first 23 games of the season. The Tigers are 8-3 when Jackson reaches base at least twice per game via hit or walk. Jackson made another highlight play in the ninth when he leaped and grabbed a ball hit by RF Jeff Francoeur that struck the top of the fence in left center. Jackson snared the ball on the home-run side of the fence and threw it in, with Francoeur being tagged out. But second base umpire Tim McClelland, working his 4,000th game, inadvertently signaled ground-rule double and Francoeur was sent back to second, where he was standing when the game ended.

New York is 6-5 since its mega-trade with Denver for Carmelo Anthony, and its defense -- not a strength to begin with -- is getting worse. In their last four games, the Knicks have given up an average of 112.5 points.

Since throwing the perfect game in Seattle, Humber allowed nine runs against Boston, and then followed that up on Wednesday by allowing three runs in a no-decision while walking six. Manager Robin Ventura did his best damage control, pointing out that Humber became a father just 24 hours earlier, with his wife delivering a son to the couple, as well as the hangover from the perfect game. "He's kind of been in a whirlwind," Ventura said. Humber said he just wanted to "get back to the basics."

Thibodeau has talked about the rotation being fairly set and not changing, so I read that as he will continue to use the bench. I do think the starters' minutes will increase slightly. And you might see subtle things like Kurt Thomas and Omer Asik used more situationally than permanently. However, it's clear the bench has been a huge component to the team's success and I don't see Thibodeau giving that up.

If a high percentage of a group is vaccinated, even those who are not immunized are effectively protected by what is known as "herd immunity."

As a teenager, Mannion had an up-and-down season for the Beavers in 2011. He threw for 3,328 yards – the third-most prolific season for an OSU quarterback. He also threw 18 interceptions. And he knows that fans expect that first number to go up and that second one to go down.
But just as much, it was a string of mediocre seasons in the early 2000s that had fans wondering whether it was finally time for Paterno to step aside.

Ten years ago, it was tough to buy fresh shellfish in landlocked cities like ours. Not today. Fresh fish is flown in daily and sold at most grocers.

Chuck took the microphone and shouted out Sylvia Robinson, Farrakhan, and Occupy Wall Street, condemned Arizona politics and the execution of Troy Davis, and spoke out against America's wars. These may not have been be your issues, but that hardly mattered: you were looking at a man with convictions and dedication (and music) to back them up. The old emcee still knows what so many have forgotten for art's sake: If you've got a microphone or an instrument plugged into a speaker, if you've got an audience willing to listen, don't waste the gift. You've got the expressive power of human language open to you: say something. And damn the game if it don't mean nothing.

We could continue in the he-growled, she-roared mode, but let's not. Pickets, investigations and court cases notwithstanding, most folks probably know what they think about performing animals already, just as they have their positions staked out on whether pit bulls are a good idea. Because animals don't talk -- except in animated films, where they won't shut up -- people are free to project soothingly pure and absolutist visions onto their behaviors.

SB522 passed unanimously, thank goodness, and it offers the sort of common sense that you sometimes can only legislate.

"The only guy who knows that is Sam himself, but I know he's sore. You come off a night game, get on the flight, so today we fully expected he would be sore. The question is how sore and how quickly (he can practice or play). We're going to be very careful with it. Should we get to the point again where we say, 'Nah, we're not taking it,' then we won't take any chances. We felt pretty comfortable with this one, and certainly he did. It's hard to tell that guy not toplay, but we'll be smart."

The bill, which has the support of Gov. Mark Dayton, creates a felony provision in state law that would target caregivers who intentionally deprive vulnerable adults of food, clothing, shelter, health care or supervision.

The fact is that 75 percent of the roads currently open to street-legal vehicles will remain open. The majority of the roads proposed for closure were already closed by previous Forest Service decisions and are the most poorly maintained in the national forest. The Forest Service can't afford to maintain everything it has, and these roads are already deteriorating at an alarming rate, causing serious and long-term ecological degradation. If the Forest Service establishes a road system it can afford to maintain, then there will be reliable, consistent and accessible roads for the public to use for the long term, and that isn't the case now.

"My work is difficult to collect — it's sort of the opposite of the canvas you hang with two nails," said Burden. "It takes a brave person to buy something that complicated." The artist takes it as a sign that Berggruen is serious about donating the works and does not plan on flipping them at auction — a reasonable suspicion considering the volume he is buying. "They are awkward and difficult works. If he was a speculator, he wouldn't be buying my work."
Haren gave up a single to center by Brett Lawrie on his first pitch of the third, ending a streak of 17 1-3 consecutive hitless innings by Angels pitchers (54 batters) following Weaver's gem and Jerome Williams' complete-game shutout.

Concerned about the disease among baby boomers, the CDC plans to issue a recommendation this year that everyone born between 1945 and 1965 be tested. Up until now, the federal agency only urged screening for those believed to be at risk.

So it makes sense that March also ushers in a plethora of plant sales in the desert.
My second suggestion is about letting firefighters hold second, part-time jobs. The city's done a lousy job for decades of monitoring and enforcing the rules around secondary employment. The firefighters themselves should show us a plan to better monitor this. It's a matter of their own safety, isn't it? If a firefighters works so many hours that he is not alert, doesn't that endanger the firefighter working with him to put out a fire?
About this time every season I try to pick out those that I like who might actually have a chance of winning. I’m invariably disappointed every time. This time, my picks are Leif (who doesn’t have a chance) Chelsea, and Sabrina. I reserve the right to change my choices if any of the aforementioned Survivors start acting like idiots. It’s happened before.

But this year, state environmental officials believe things could be changing for New Jersey bats. Mick Valent, principal zoologist with the state Division of Fish and Wildlife, said this is the first time officials have not seen a decline in the bat population in the Hibernia mine, and it seems like the numbers of those infected are leveling off.

Credit card companies will loan you thousands of dollars and tell you that you have a small minimum payment. But with very high interest rates and minimum payments, it can take forever to pay off a balance. Remember, billion-dollar finance companies generally are housed in very nice buildings. If you have a credit card, use it prudently and for emergencies  then pay it off every month.
With road losses by Washington and Stanford on Thursday night, the conference is without a 3-0 team. So, despite the slow starts, the Beavers are just a game and a half out of first place in the up-for-grabs Pac-12.

Adele’s “21” is nominated for Album of the Year, an award it is quite likely to win.
But it wasn’t a man allegedly getting raped. It was a boy. Paterno can’t spin this as “an old-world man profoundly confused by what (Mike) McQueary told him,” as Jenkins writes, because there’s no debating about what’s right or wrong here. There’s no gray area. No matter how detailed McQueary was in his account, this was a grown man allegedly doing something sexual with a young boy.
CY: There has never been a better time to hire someone straight out of college. Social media platforms in a specific sense may be fads, but they will be replaced by bigger better platforms. Companies need people who are natives in this new communication landscape. For example, an undersized offensive lineman who is an academic all American and will have a masters focused largely in digital brand building.

With no players around to be evaluated, Kubiak was free to work on his schemes and figure out what he wasn't doing well and how to get better. Wade Phillips has showed his defensive coaching skills in directing that unit's turnaround, but Kubiak deserves credit for having his team, his offense, ready to play every week.

The anticipated demand for a race view stems partly from the relative rarity of the America's Cup taking place in America. The race hasn't been held in the U.S. since 1995, and in recent years has taken place off the coast of New Zealand and Spain. (The race was named by the New York Yacht Club after the schooner America, which beat the British in a race in 1851.)
At one point, Ponder spent nearly a half hour beside offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave, freshening up on some of the details of the Vikings offense. A bit earlier, Phil Loadholt, John Sullivan, Charlie Johnson and Brandon Fusco watched offensive line drills while keeping a close eye on rookie hot shot Matt Kalil, the left tackle out of Southern California the Vikings plucked with the No. 4 pick in the draft last week.

A liver-loving companion wanted to try Viaduct's chicken liver special ($14). I braced myself and took a bite. It was heavenly: breaded, fried and well-seasoned, the livers were crunchy outside, mild and buttery tender inside. The slightly bitter aftertaste was nicely countered by a sweet, jammy port reduction. Big flavors in the accompanying cheddar-jalapeno grits, studded with bits of house-made bacon, finished off a winning combination.
Calipari didn't invoke the Rose connection when he was recruiting Davis.
It's just that simple: If you want to stay in the food business, you better sell customers what they want to eat. Yet, instead of accommodating consumer demands, the beef industry has alleged that some dudes were manipulated by the media. Then it held a press conference to manipulate the media, itself.
Under the deal, the collection would reside part-time in Nashville and part-time in Bentonville, Ark., where the Crystal Bridges Museum is located. The university would receive $30 million as part of the agreement, according to the Tennessean.
The defense contends the money provided by Edwards benefactors Rachel "Bunny'' Mellon and Fred Baron were not political donations, but personal gifts to help a friend hide the affair from his wife. Elizabeth Edwards died in December 2010 from breast cancer.

Of course, they would have been better if Wally Szczerbiak were still here, but Wally was not athletic enough in the playoffs. J.J. Hickson and Anderson Varejao provide "make two/miss one" foibles at the line, but their rebounding and offensive activity around the rim make up for it.
The Beastie Boys opened for Madonna on tour in the 1980s, and the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last month.
The numbers are very preliminary and could change in the next 10 months, but the problem is simple arithmetic: Costs are rising faster than revenue, particularly in the area of pension and health, which the freeholders are obligated to pay. To keep spending level — without a large and unexpected uptick in revenue — the freeholders would have to drastically reduce services.

"I know free throws are one of my strong points," Fryrear said. "When I get to the line, I feel confident."
Just like that, all would be well -- as if we never needed the trust-busting of the Progressive Era, the social legislation of the New Deal, the health programs of the Great Society, and the coordinated action of the world's governments in 2008 and 2009 to keep the great recession from becoming something far worse.

Sacramento Superior Court Judge Timothy Frawley ruled in December against the Assembly in the public-records suit filed by The Bee and Los Angeles Times.
Finally, long-term relationships are at stake. I'm thinking mostly of efforts in the U.S. to create relationships among Christians, Muslims and Jews. It's not that my friends who are rabbis will totally cut me off. But they will wonder what kind of church I belong to and what message it sends for me to remain part of a church that retreats behind such a simplistic solution. It means that their congregants who hear the screams from the Jewish right denouncing all mainline Protestants — and maybe all Christians — as untrustworthy will have a harder time offering a countervailing view. The unfortunate truth is, we tend to stay in our own ghettos. It's part of a larger, unhealthy syndrome of isolationism. How can it help the relationships among Jews, Christians and Muslims if we never sit together?

"The people who are gay or transgender or queer are hypersexualized in the community, whereas people who have disabilities are seen as asexual," says Emi Koyama, Bridges volunteer coordinator, and that can make dealing with family difficult.
The bills that passed the Senate Pensions & Investment committee this morning would prevent that kind of arrangment going forward. One bill also would retroactively reverse a similar type of arrangement in which union officials who weren't teachers to begin with were allowed to climb on board the teacher pension system with brief teaching stints.
The cities are finalists to host more than 300 people in 2012 for several days of discussions, events and tours sponsored by The Project for Public Spaces, a nonprofit group based in New York.
Before the game, Scioscia acknowledged Pujols is "clearly not in sync." He was 1 for 4 Saturday, setting up the Angels' first run with a first-inning single. But his last three at-bats (two ground outs and a called third strike) gave further evidence of Scioscia's sync-ing feeling and dropped Pujols' average to .226. Pujols has ended April with a batting average over .320 seven times in his career and under .250 just once before (.245 last season).

A. I don't blame them. I came on the scene looking rather like I'd come out of the '30s. The Method kids had taken over, while I spoke well; I seemed a bit out of the Ronald Colman era. So I got all these stuffy roles.
“It is our policy to not discuss any completed, ongoing or potential research cases unless at the specific request of family members,” according to a statement released by the center. “Our primary goal is to learn more about the long-term effects of repetitive brain trauma by conducting meaningful scientific research.

The first time I saw this scientific inclination was just after the recent 40 days and nights of rain. The sun was out, the windows were down and the car filled with cut-grass-scented air. On the highway, wind buffeted us violently, but we were all so happy to see the sun again no one cared. My two oldest boys were in the very back of our station wagon, watching the world speed away from them. The air flowing into the car circulates wildly in the back, and the boys love it: their hair flies this way and that and they giggle as we travel. So much better than the bickering I hear when the windows are up and they're bored.

But food isn't Burger King's only problem. Many of its restaurants are showing signs of aging. So the company decided it wanted to give them a more modern look that mixes leather armchairs, high stools and plastic chairs in warmer lighting. High partitions will create more privacy in some seating areas. The makeover costs an average of more than $275,000 per restaurant.

The reason it's impossible to dismiss Lin is that he has been the catalyst of the Knicks' seven-game winning streak. Last night, he scored less than 20 points for the first time during the streak while shooting just six times (making four), which is eight fewer shots than he took in any previous game of the win streak.
Much was made at the symposium of the figurative inhumanity of handing war over to machines. But it seems to me war, in some ways, might be more humane if fought by robots. Untainted by human emotions, robot soldiers wouldn't rape thousands of German women the way Russian soldiers did as they advanced on Berlin at the end of World War II, or deliberately massacre scores of civilians in revenge for heavy casualties as U.S. troops infamously did at My Lai during the Vietnam war. Panelists at the symposium wondered if robots would really be able to tell a farmer's hoe or hunting rifle from a soldier's AK-47 before firing at somebody in a combat zone, ignoring the fact that human troops have trouble doing so right now.

This is the challenge for the melancholy Oliver (Ewan McGregor), who at 38 is stunted, a human bonsai. Since the death of Oliver's mother, his vivacious father, Hal (Christopher Plummer), has come out of the closet and into his own. Hal, a museum curator, thrives in the sunshine of attention. This has the effect of leaving Oliver, a graphic artist with a pronounced charisma deficit, in the shadow of his own introversion.

Team members said total agricultural production for 2010 is reported at 5.12 million metric tons, well short of the need of 7.93 million metric tons for a population of 24 million. North Korea had planned to buy 325,000 tons of food on the global market this year, the team reported, but rapidly rising prices have cut the likely purchase to 200,000 tons.

Back over to the west, right on Route 12 beyond Jessie's Grove, I found an even homier scene at Michael-David Vineyards, makers of 7 Deadly Zins. The Phillips family has been farming fruits, vegetables and grapes for eons, and they run a funky roadside café and produce stand, so in 1984, Michael Phillips started fermenting the family grape juice and selling it alongside the tomatoes. In 2000, along with brother David, he blended up seven different lots of Zinfandel, gave it that goofy name (which they say does well in the Bible Belt), and sold out their 800 cases in six months. Last year, they sold 100,000 cases of the same wine. But when I stopped in at the café for a bowl of tortilla soup, I found not a wine titan but a straight-up farmer in old jeans, battered work boots and an ill-fitting green T-shirt.
A Kasich spokesman conceded that issue immediately after the budget was released but insisted the agency is "duplicative" and that's reason enough for the cut.

Among the pet health problems seen at Dove Lewis related to raw food: bacterial infections, intestinal damage from bone shards that are too large, and food obstructions, she notes. "Some animals end up with intestinal impactions because the (raw food) recipe is not good for that pet and the food forms a hard ball instead of passing through the system," Muzatko says.
The dilemma for Obama is that non-liberals don't see the situation the same way. As nearly every poll shows, more than 70 percent of Americans believe we're on the wrong track, and the number of people calling themselves conservative continues to grow, as does the number of moderates who say they lean to the right. According to the Pew Research Center, the average voter places himself twice as far from Democrats as he does from Republicans.
And while hundreds of thoroughfares throughout the nation have Broadway streets that are named after the Great White Way in New York, Broadway Road in the Valley is named after a former Maricopa County sheriff, farmer and canal builder, Noah Broadway, who served as a lawman in the 1890s.
With Denver showing the expected greater fight for fear of heading home with a 2-0 series deficit, Bryant huddled with Bynum on the bench while they rested early in the fourth quarter — getting ready to work together again through critical late-game minutes.

He also bothers to color in the backgrounds with believable characters and telling details that push the story forward.

Two well-known attractions have been updated and upgraded at Disney World parks. In late spring, Star Tours reopened at Disney's Hollywood Studios. The simulator, which made its debut in 1989, still features the "Star Wars" universe but is now seen in 3-D and has a rotating lineup of interplanetary scenes.

The queue area has been rethemed a bit, but the shining star is the new digital film, which gives an eye-opening view of locales such as Naboo, Hoth, Kashyyyk (aka the Wookie Planet) and the Death Star.

At the beginning of the film, Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) stare directly into the camera, which is a surrogate for an unseen divorce-court judge. Simin is explaining that she wants to leave Iran so their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, the director's daughter) will have more opportunities for a better life. Just what does that mean? the judge asks; Simin doesn't answer, looking away, but it is not hard to deduce what she means: She wants her daughter raised in a more open society, where women are treated more equally.

Although the industry's stated reason for wanting to erase the advertising rule is that it "hides" taxes, another is that each new regulation brings with it the possibility of more fines. Darryl Jenkins, the chairman of the American Aviation Institute, referred to the DOT as a "rulemaking machine" in a recent editorial in the trade publication Aviation Daily and said that the agency is more destructive to the airline industry's viability than anything he's ever seen.

"Tony tells me about spending time with Earl Weaver and Billy Martin, and Whitey telling me Wednesday about his biggest influence, and where he got a lot of stuff, was Casey Stengel. How about putting together wisdom from Stengel, from Weaver, from Billy Martin, and throwing that all together with the success of La Russa, of a Schoendienst, a Herzog? That's a lot of baseball experience for me to draw on."

In the Sinfonia Concertante, violinist Christian Tetzlaff and violist Antoine Tamestit (making an impressive festival debut) were nicely matched as soloists. From its brisk, pert opening, Tetzlaff's fiery showmanship and bright sound played well off of Tamestit's confident and velvet-toned but more controlled flights. Tetzlaff exaggerated some of its more dramatic, stylized gestures in a winking, charming way, although in some of the many exposed virtuosic passages his intonation became erratic.

Moeller is obviously more experienced and he may pack a little more punch. But Bryant has as much talent and is as smart about the game as Moeller. He's more prepared than many freshmen would be. And while Moeller was a linebacker who moved to safety and then the star nickel back position, Bryant is a natural safety and corner who moved there, so I expect his cover skills might be better. As good as Moeller is, I don't think Bryant will be overmatched once he gets comfortable.

A hard cap levels the entire playing field and, in fact, could penalize a team that has a player like James. Teams who have players making huge money -- James will likely be one of the league's highest-paid players for the next decade (right now he's just the 19th-highest paid, believe it or not) -- may not have the options to surround that player with as much talent.

A large plate of fragrant basmati rice, speckled with carrot bits and peas, accompanies main dishes.

Economists agree that a handful of cities in eastern China have joined the First World. Tens of millions of families now enjoy a middle-class existence. But China has more than 1.3 billion people -- most of whom do not live in these relatively privileged areas. Commentators who focus on the sheer size of China's economy often lose sight of that fact. On a per-capita basis, China's national income (adjusted for purchasing power) is about $6,000 a year. The U.S. figure is more than $47,000.

Some American wineries make blanc de noirs sparklers, which we included in this tasting. Blanc de noirs, made from Pinot Noir and sometimes Pinot Meunier grapes, generally lack any pink or rosy hue, hence the moniker "white from black."

Emerald Frequency will perform prior to the play. Describing themselves as an "indie Celtic band," the duo has been grabbing the attention of folks throughout the Northeastern Ohio area and beyond. Emerald Frequency, which was created in the fall of 2003, is not a total Irish band, but their influence and love of Ireland and its music is heard throughout the music that they play.

It is a journey from the mystical to the raucous; from the light-hearted to the thought provoking; from the serene to the energetic; from earth to the heavens and back again. The duo recently released its first CD Enchanted Grove that contains a variety of songs and original numbers.

"We are looking at our fourth consecutive year of reductions, and we know there will be more service reductions coming in the next fiscal year," said county spokeswoman Chris Andis. She said the county has reorganized how it does business to save money while minimizing the impact to services, but even so service delivery takes longer, building inspections may not be done on the same day and phone calls take longer to return. "It has been tough... and we have more to do," Andis said.

Houston is already taking steps to give the people what they want, launching a downtown bike share program and expanding the White Oak Bayou trail. But many Houstonians don't live or work downtown. The city needs a comprehensive bicycle system that isn't just for recreation, but provides a safe and easy way for people to travel between homes and businesses, serving all of our dynamic yet disparate cores.
There were two big economic stories of the last decade, and only one has produced popular literature so far. If you want to bone up on the 2008-2009 developed financial crisis, there are numerous comprehensive volumes and a few too many movies. But rare is the book that does justice to the world's other dramatic tale—the rise of the developing world. That's probably because few analysts combine the broad perspective and the country-specific knowledge necessary to write authoritatively about growth in China, India, Turkey and Mexico.

Carolina, took significant amounts of Federal monies; in the case of Belmont Abbey, they were also successful in becoming legally eligible for state funding that was specifically reserved for - secular institutions.

A lot of the trend stories you point to as proof of the shallow, stupid voter really exemplify the shallow, stupid media instead. The Wall Street Journal piece about Obama being "too thin" is a perfect example of an odd trend I see in which media elites that live in the enclaves of New York and Washington try to guess what we, the great unwashed red-state Americans, are like. The stereotype that we're fat and proud is only partly true -- if middle Americans didn't appreciate a slim physique as much as coastal Americans, Jenny Craig wouldn't make much money. Digging up two random quotes to fit a preordained belief about corn-fed voters might make jaunty prose, but it proves nothing.
Inside the state, Newberry said, the SAO can be a voice for the industry.

When I was a college freshman, my PE course included a "Health and Hygiene" unit. When we got to the section on "posture," the instructor — a taciturn, middle-aged woman in a baseball cap — had an interesting approach. Each young woman in the class (one at a time) was required to pose nude before Ms. D. and her camera, showing our best posture. Pleas to wear underwear fell on deaf ears. We were assured that individual silhouettes would not be recognized when we critiqued photographs together as a class. That was in 1956.

Not even close to what the young boys at Penn State endured, but there is one common denominator — adults in authority.

So far, this has been a really great experience with this one film. Everyone has been so nice and so wonderful to me, and that’s been really great. But on the flip side, I get that it isn’t always going to be like that. There are certainly other things I’d like to do with my life, as well.

When a team has two of the most pressing defensive needs in football — pass rushing and pass defending — a move needs to be made.

I bring on people when I like what they do and they like what I do,” Hall said from his New York home. “That can be an idol, like Smokey Robinson or Cee Lo, it can be Sharon Jones or Mayer Hawthorne. I have found that I have gravitated to people that play what I call ‘nu soul,’ which is classic soul framed for today.”

That's easier said than done with Brady, a former sixth-round draft pick who is 3-1 in Super Bowl starts. Not only do the Patriots use a no-huddle formation to speed up the pace of the game, preventing defensive substitutions, Brady is among the fastest decision-makers in league history. And few quarterbacks are as effective moving just a few inches within the limited space behind the line of scrimmage to avoid the pass rush. A step there, a slide there, and Brady frustrates hardworking defensive linemen perhaps more than any other quarterback.
A blown opportunity by the Blazers.
The next morning, I Bixied through the Plateau to St-Viateur Bagel, whose bagels (sorry, New York) are the best in the world, especially when fresh from the oven, and poked around Schwartz's for whiffs of another local specialty, smoked meat, such as hard-core pastrami.

They avoided such a fate from the very first period Wednesday, when they swarmed the Toronto goal like locust on crop. They were relentless, constantly moving, passing, in, out, back, shot, there, there, always there, scraping up enough ice to build a snow mountain and firing shots at Toronto's Ken Wregget that smacked of anger, nobody was going to beat them in this building, and so when the weary puck tried to escape someone in red always brought it back.

I've covered golf at Augusta National over the years. I'm not there this year, but I'm following closely mostly because of Tiger Woods. When I saw the replays of Tiger muttering profanities, throwing down a club, and kicking a club, I first thought about what a poor sport he was.

Let's take a look at the Planning Commission agenda for this week (a document that is a little more difficult to find). The Planning Commission, in many cases, is the final decision-making body for land use applications (unless their vote is appealed to the City Council). The first order of business on the Commission's agenda is always the Call to Order by the chair, followed by Roll Call of the five commissioners, each of whom serves at the pleasure of a city council member. Next, the chairperson selects a member of the commission to lead the Pledge of Allegiance and, in many communities, an invocation that would be led either by a member of the clergy or one of the commissioners follows. Irvine observes a moment of silence. The chairperson then asks the Director of Community Services if there are any introductions, such as new staff members, notable figures or guests in attendance, and if there are any late additions or deletions for the agenda.

To be sure, gas-powered cars are hardly invulnerable. Plenty of motorists ran out of fuel on that long drive home. But my hunch is that electrics would have faced similar problems or worse. And many electric-car drivers who did manage to limp home would have been out of options the next day: You can't recharge if you don't have electricity, and hundreds of thousands of customers were blacked out the following day from the snow.

Roger Waters' live interpretation of the seminal Pink Floyd album, "The Wall," has been hailed as one of the best large-scale tours of the past decade (more enthralling than even stadium-hoppers U2). Waters last played Denver's Pepsi Center on Nov. 23, 2010 and will return on Monday for another sold out show. Of the 2010 performance, Reverb writer Candace Horgan said: "The spectacle part of the show ranged from a series of sparklers shot from above to mimic an airplane firing bullets, to the giant, menacing puppets of the teacher and a woman that resembled a praying mantis." Stuff your pockets with cash and try your luck outside the Pepsi Center — this one's worth it.

The biggest move in our new mock draft is Texas A&M quarterback Ryan Tannehill rising to No. 4 to Cleveland (we had him going to Miami at No. 8 last week). Tannehill will be a pivotal pick in how the first round unfolds. He's rumored to be going anywhere between No. 3 (if the Vikings can find a trade partner) and No. 8 to the Dolphins—or he could fall out of the top 10. Because we move up Tannehill, the domino effect means LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne falls to Jacksonville at No. 7.

I've been a flat-out "news junkie" since I could talk. From the late 1930s onward, my mother instilled in me the desire to listen to radio (and eventually television) newscasts, to know what was happening in the world. Thanks to her tutoring, I could name every state capital by the time I was four (circa 1940). She emphasized knowledge was one of the most important factors in life. I represented Pittsburgh in the semi-finals for the national spelling bee in 1949. Obviously, mine was a very special Mom and pumped information into my noggin almost as similarly and as diligently as the fictional Jorel's words being pumped into baby Superman's head during his journey in the capsule from Krypton to Earth (in the movie "Superman", of course.)

The Medicare findings are bad news for President Barack Obama and his health care overhaul that is bogged down in Congress. That's because the higher Medicare Advantage premiums for 2010 followed a cut in government payments to the private plans last year. And the Democratic bills pending in Congress call for even more cuts, which are expected to force many seniors to drop out of what has been a rapidly growing alternative to traditional Medicare.

When we opened, there were around 12 just within the city limits. Now there are nine, but some have only one guest room.

The chow: When you go to a Vietnamese restaurant with "Pho" in the name, you can guess their specialty is Pho. And, with 18 versions on the menu, you'd be right. Of these, the not-to-be-missed version is the Pho Chin, Nam ($6.50). Served, as Pho typically is, in a bowl so large any other culture would use it to serve side dishes to multiple guests, it is a fairly simple soup, containing only scallions and onions, an enormous mess of slippery noodles and thin, but wide, strips of beef. The beef is somewhat overcooked, making it slightly tougher and chewier than it should be, but the vegetables are fresh, the broth is aromatic and filling, and the side plate heaped with crisp bean sprouts, fragrant Thai basil and delicate sprigs of cilantro allows you to add a sprightly crunch to your meal.

Raising alcohol taxes would have a big effect on adolescents and heavy drinkers, but many problem users of alcohol would have enough money to keep guzzling. Some of them like to drink and drive, or drink and beat up other people. Telling them not to misbehave does not do much good, because being drunk makes them less responsive to the threat of criminal penalties. So we need to find ways of preventing drinking among the relatively small group of people who behave very badly when they drink.

The best food-truck food comes from existing eateries: On Friday, a group of five young adults walked by the Hancock Tower, turned onto Stuart Street and let out whoops and fist pumps at the site of the Redbones truck. Good reason — the truck offers the same great smoky meat you get at the popular Somerville barbecue joint. It’s cheaper, too! A single St. Louis Rib at the restaurant costs $4.99. But you can steal three for $6 at the food truck. KickAss Cupcakes also provides the same great experience out of the truck as it does at its retail store in Somerville.

We note that “Restless City” is photographed by Bradford Young, who did “Pariah,” another small-budget independent that looked wonderful, and yet, for all of its obvious budgetary limitations, had the advantage of a canny, quietly riveting story.

The star, however, is the pizza, 12 inches of crisp crust spun lavash-thin and quickly christened in a furiously hot wood-burning oven so it emerges bubbly and puffy-edged. It's a style Franchetti perfected during training earlier this year at Vera Pizza Napoletana, the Italian-sanctioned academy of traditional Neapolitan pies in Marina del Rey (Los Angeles County).

Vandross included a studio version of "A House Is Not a Home" on his 1981 debut album, "Never Too Much."

No one quite made it his or her own the way Vandross (who died in 2005) did.

Director William Wellman’s resume is peppered with classic films of every genre from gangster (1931’s THE PUBLIC ENEMY) to epic adventure (1939’s BEAU GESTE) to drama (1943’s THE OX-BOW INCIDENT) to comedy (1942’s ROXIE HART, the first film version of the smash musical CHICAGO), but if you were to pick just one film from his illustrious career to represent him as a filmmaker, A STAR IS BORN would be it. The film was nominated for all the top Academy Awards of 1938 (Picture, Director, Actress and Actor) and while it only won a statue for writing, it has gone down in the history books as a much more popular and influential film than what did win Best Picture that year, THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA. Wellman hit just the right note across the board with A STAR IS BORN. It is fast paced, timelessly funny, brutally honest and still a tear jerker.

A: Huck Finn. It's a 130-year-old book and it was written about some of the toughest issues our country has faced, and still faces, and it was written with a sense of humor.

But the past few years have not been ideal for big fish. Cult Cabernet languished in the Mina cellar for several years, Parr recalls.

Since March, just 5% of coverage was devoted to those topics. For Santorum, the media paid marginal attention to him beyond his role in strategy in 2011, but as he emerged as a viable candidate, 18% of its coverage of Santorum focused on his policies and background.

Looking forward to another year of your insights into the Sox. I had hoped Robin would be a different type of manager than Ozzie. But, after watching him do nothing about Rios' lackadaisical play and dropping another routine fly ball, I don't see anyone calling him out for his play. Do you think anything might be said in the privacy of the clubhouse? Given the chance I would have sent Fukodome to replace him immediately. Bob Sagen, Fort Mohave, Ariz.

Manning's supporters — who include, most prominently, Daniel Ellsberg, the former military analyst who released the Vietnam War records known as the Pentagon Papers — say the information he is accused of leaking was incorrectly and illegally classified.

One was the way he ended it. He waited eight days and that limited the Cavs' options to improve after he left. Doing it on national television while not showing the courtesy to personally inform the Cavs he was leaving. Especially the way he was treated by the team and the city. The other was that even though he gave the Cavs seven seasons, taking the shorter three-year deal didn't seem to fairly give the team a chance to build long term around him. They competed year-to-year because they were attempting to keep him happy.

In the late '60s, during the Johnson presidency, a big shift occurred when he decreed that only wines from the United States would be served in the White House. This tradition has continued ever since, in part because the shift took place at the perfect time in our country's wine history: the beginning of our meteoric rise to excellence in winemaking. Until then, no fine restaurant in New York City (or any other major city) would carry a wine from Oregon or Washington, let alone Arizona. There may have been a Beaulieu Vineyards, "George de Latour" Cabernet Sauvignon or an early Robert Mondavi Reserve, but that was about it.

I love good champagne, but unfortunately the word "champagne" has become a license to print money.

A: I still enjoy it, but it's not the same. It used to be a really powerful addiction. It used to be an exclusive club. Most of us in Northern California were not interested in contests.

Juan Pablo Flores asked the mayor's panel whether immigrants could be assured that if they reported a crime, police would not ask for immigration documents.
Parking is obviously key to any development that hopes to draw millions of visitors a year. But, for Cleveland, so is attracting a critical mass of residents -- and keeping those who already have made the move downtown.
"She had a very late growth spurt and for a long time was gangly and awkward. She had to develop a sense of humor. She's so beautiful and talented and funny and has a heart and empathizes for the underdog."
For example, this reporter, who had never shot a gun before, arrived at an elegant wood-paneled La Romana club several weeks ago, and picked up his first rifle. A group of men and women who had mostly never fired such a weapon spent their afternoon getting in touch with their inner Charlton Heston. (We just destroyed clay pigeons, but still.) The group only disbanded when it ran out of ammo.
"Yeah, normally they don't let you keep it," he says, grinning like a kid who just shocked his fourth-grade class during show and tell. "I had to argue a lot to get it. My oncologist thought I was crazy. I have a piece of my colon downstairs."
Rebels withdrew from Ishasha on Sunday because "we wanted to show that we are for peace and our objective is not to take other areas," spokesman Bertrand Bisimwa said.
Maintaining Embassytown is important for two reasons: the planet's unusual technologies and its position at the edge of unexplored space. Embassytown is sheltered by a bubble of breathable air within the Ariekei's city — Embassytowners call the Ariekeis "Hosts" — and its infrastructure is partially organic, as is all the infrastructure of the host planet. "Beyond kilometres of roofs, past rotating church-beacons, were the power stations," writes Miéville in the first chapter, signaling but not explaining the unusual technology. "They had been made uneasy by the landing, and were still skittish, days later. I could see them stamping."

In a competition, pigeons are taken to a release point anywhere from a few to several hundred miles away from their "homes." Each bird has a band on its leg that registers with a clock when they return to the loft. The clock calculates each bird's speed.
The price of crude has declined as the U.S. dollar has strengthened against other currencies, economists say. The cost of oil, which is priced in dollars, falls as the rising dollar makes it more expensive for investors using foreign currency. But that dynamic can change quickly.

"I will say from all of my experiences and exposure to Delmon Young, I have never felt that he is anti-Semetic. ... If we felt that he was — or any of our players — it would not be tolerated," Dombrowski said. "From an organization perspective, you support your employees, on the field, off the field, if you think they need support. You're in a position where you don't condone certain behaviors, and you let them know that, but you work with them."
Headroom of 38.6 inches in the well-bolstered Charger front seats provides most drivers and passengers with comfortable resting spots and decent views out over the slightly domed, aluminum hood. The Avalon has a bit more headroom-- 38.9 inches in the front seat.
In a 12-inning marathon victory the previous night, Girardi called upon both Cory Wade and David Phelps to deliver multiple innings. Neither allowed a run in 2âÂ Â innings. Neither was available Wednesday night. The same applied for David Robertson and, at least initially, Rivera.

Holmes is one of six freshmen Enfield brought in after getting the job last April. Holmes, a 6-3, 185-pound guard, has played in four of the team's five games and is averaging five points in 16 minutes a game. Though shooting a respectable 8-for-17 from the field, Holmes has struggled with turnovers (11) and fouls (12).
On our last morning in the park, we struck up a conversation with a couple who had arrived from New Jersey. We had returned to Zabriskie Point to see one more sunrise and, on the spot, the couple decided to rework their vacation itinerary so they could stay here longer. Hope they had plenty of memory cards for all the great pictures.
Then there's the 34-year-old Ayala, who quickly became a clubhouse favorite this spring. Signed as a free agent Feb. 10, the veteran right-hander was 2-2 with a 2.09 ERA in 56 innings with the New York Yankees last season after spending 2010 toiling in the minors. Ayala might be the most flexible member of the bullpen because he can come in to pitch to one batter with his sinker to get a double-play ball or be used in multiple innings — he pitched more than one inning 18 times last season and threw two innings eight times.
Gas companies have begun extracting natural gas in Pennsylvania and West Virginia from the low-density shale that extends throughout much of the Appalachian Basin. In Ohio, that hasn't happened yet.

St. Louis officials are not talking about building a new stadium to match the flashy facilities built in recent years.

Compared with their high-school classmates who don't continue their studies, college-bound students have higher family income, higher high-school grades and better standardized-test scores.

WellCare can only blame so much on the broader Wall Street meltdown. Investor appeal was dampened by a lingering, 18-month Medicaid fraud investigation.

That's especially so at the treasury, where minding the store is a must. Periodically -- before the Civil War, before World War I, late in the 1920s, in 1970 and early in the 1980s -- something at Ohio's treasury goes very wrong. And even when the treasurer is personally blameless, that's whom voters blame. If, between anti-Brown campaign stunts, Mandel finds time to stop by the office he was elected to run, he might care to recall that fact.

A current theory is that the outbreak started in the town of La Gloria on the eastern coast of Mexico, because a 5-year-old boy was the first known case.

Shirvington has a terrific story to tell, and she does a great job of slowly unspooling a complicated plot involving angels at war, but her writing style lacks grace. Her description of an exiled angel named Phoenix as "pretty damn close to a perfect brooding hottie" demonstrates her lead character's liberal use of base, if modern, language and further undermines the book's literary aspirations.

This is not to say that studio financing automatically militates against artistry. In three bigger-budget American movies on this year's noncompetitive program, performing artists either transcended pretty good material, or graced excellent scripts with extraordinary performances. I've never seen anything like Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrait of Truman Capote in "Capote," which is set in the middle of the 20th century, when the writer was working on his ground-breaking nonfiction crime novel "In Cold Blood." In addition to capturing Capote's eccentricities, and his piping, petulant voice, Mr. Hoffman gives us a literary lion turned ferocious investigative tiger, plus shameless wheedler, fearless detective, ruthless manipulator and ultimately soul mate of one of his subjects, the stone killer Perry Smith. (Catherine Keener's performance as the novelist Harper Lee is more restrained but no less notable; it's the best thing she's ever done.)

•The New Deal. The Sun had things right in 1932 when it endorsed New York Gov.Franklin D. Roosevelt for president. But as it became clear what the New Deal meant — a vastly expanded role for the government in the economy — The Sun balked, eventually splitting with the president altogether. Its support (despite the lack of a formal endorsement) was no help to Kansas Gov. Alfred Landon, who lost the 1936 presidential race by the biggest electoral college landslide in history: 523-8.

In the 1980s as now, the question arose: If you were eating City Restaurant's spicy Thai duck curry, how was it different from the duck curry you could get at the Thai restaurant up the street? Short answer: It wasn't. As in the best restaurants in Thai Town, the curry was made from scratch, using then-rare ingredients like kaffir lime and fresh turmeric, and the ducks may well have come from the same farm. The grilled Japanese eggplant that was a major component of the dish was as fragrant and pudding-like as it would have been at a restaurant like Jitlada. It wasn't a riff on Thai duck curry, a fantasy on a theme of Thai duck curry or a chiefly re-imagining of Thai duck curry — it was a Thai duck curry, and a pretty good one.

The revitalization of urban life, with its varied and crosscutting relationships, is a step in the right direction, too. One city going in the opposite direction is Washington, D.C., where fraternizing across party lines—once the norm—is nearly unheard of these days. Acrimony on Capitol Hill reflects, in part, these oxytocin-starved relationships.

First, we have to understand the failings of the system. Following the bombing attempt, the intelligence community came under fire for failing to "connect the dots" that could have stopped Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. But that's not right -- there weren't any dots to connect.

In "Toward You," the third in Krusoe's trilogy promising life after death, Bob, a mild-mannered upholsterer, continues work on his most fabulous invention: the Communicator, a device that enables the user to speak with the dead (something about "terminal waves" replacing sounds made by human vocal chords, but never mind).
There are many things the promising rookie can control during his time in Cleveland, ranging from work ethic to a willingness to lead the franchise's rebuilding effort to whether he re-signs with the Cavaliers.

• Early season treats Trail Blazers and Lakers differently -- Jason Quick, The Oregonian: Suddenly, the Lakers have won four out of five. In a lockout compressed schedule, there is caution that early starts – be it 1-3 for the Lakers or 4-1 for the Blazers – have a way of evening out as the schedule eventually wreaks havoc on every team. The season is still very young, and that's why Blazers interim general manager Chad Buchanan emerged from Tuesday's locker room calm as ever.

Now their message to seniors is, "Who cares about the kids! You've got yours." If changes are made to Medicare, they should apply to everyone. The fact is the Republicans cannot apply them to seniors because the proposed changes just don't work. Older citizens, especially those with medical conditions (which most of us have), are essentially uninsurable. The much vaunted "competition" the Tribune extols as the solution applies only to healthy people. There is no competition to cover seniors; in fact, the insurance companies run the other way because they cannot make money insuring seniors. Rather than condemning "Mediscare," the Tribune should condemn those who want to destroy Medicare in order to "save" it.

But don't spend too long indoors. If you time your Kaanapali exploration right, you can wind up just before sunset at Black Rock, a stony outcropping (and popular snorkeling spot) by the Sheraton.

Believing Bruce, of course, has never been an issue. His unflinching honesty, especially in instances where the truth hurts, has led to a level of trust between him and his fans that is pretty much unparalleled in the history of popular music.

And that figure is true, too. When the city calculates the cost of fire pensions - let's call it "total cost," meaning what the city must budget each year - it includes payments on debt owed. In the mid-2000s, the city shorted the system, claiming it shouldn't have to pay the rising cost of the fire pensions, which are partly controlled by the state legislature.
Judy Lisi, president of the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, said the center went into the economic downtown in a solid position, with no debt and healthy reserves.

As a non-albino white buffalo, Lightning Medicine Cloud was revered by Native Americans. Thousands of people of all races attended a naming ceremony for the unusual calf last year, and Little Soldier called it the "hope of all nations."
The day begins with a period of mindless and repetitive activity. My one-hour power walk is nominally cardio, but it's actually composition—scenes, characters, even dialogue. (There must be people in my neighborhood park who think I'm a lunatic since occasionally I move my lips while composing on the fly.) One of the reasons I so fear the over-scheduling of today's children is that most creative thought happens when you are staring into the middle distance, doing nothing at all.
The Socialists doubled their tally in the election compared to the previous one, achieving their best result since their founder Slobodan Milosevic was ousted from power in a pro-democracy uprising in 2000.
"If you do it right, it can be a steady investment income," said Jerry Earnest, chief investment officer for Entertainment Properties. "If the schools do well academically and do provide good opportunity for kids, the schools will operate for a long period of time and be a good investment."
Multnomah County and Portland Public Schools officials have criticized some of Portland's urban renewal programs because they take money from other vital human service and educational programs.
The American writer-director Stuart Cooper made "Overlord" in 1975, but only now has his remarkable film, set in England during World War II, been given an American release. (Operation Overlord was the Allied invasion of France.) Even before the action starts, the film announces its singularity with the very first title: "The Imperial War Museum Presents." The museum's vast archives, centered in London, were the source of military and newsreel footage around which the dramatic content was written and shot. (And shot superbly, in evocative black and white, by the late John Alcott, Stanley Kubrick's favorite cinematographer, whose specialty was making powerful images with the simplest possible lighting setups.)
The thought won’t go away that much of this Giants season was fueled by a miracle. Victor Cruz’s emergence was not something one could predict, and this is something we may never see again. It’s not some Damn Yankees sequel. Sure, competitive teams always need an upstart or two to provide real impact, but they don’t become a “co-MVP” of their teams, which was the term Justin Tuck used to describe Cruz the other night.
"They say if anyone is ready for kindergarten, it's Karley Jo because she's been down there her whole life," said Jackson, a past president of the Twin Echo PTA. "She's familiar with the school and she knows the teachers. So I don't think she'll have any anxiety."

As a registered professional engineer and general contractor with nearly 50 years of experience in the commercial-construction industry, I believe the seeds for this disaster were sown long before the contracts for design and construction were signed. The design-bid-build procurement system, in which design and construction services are contracted separately, and which the VA chose for this project, is to blame for setting up the problems and delays the VA is now experiencing.
Isla Espiritu Santo and Isla Partida off the shores of La Paz are both protected as part of a UNESCO biosphere reserve and are among the most popular spots for snorkeling, diving and kayaking. Sea lions congregate here and happily splash about with humans. Divers get even closer to the friendly critters while also spotting stonefish, rockfish, marine turtles and eels among towering rock and coral formations. Hammerhead sharks congregate at the Seamount (also called El Bajo) along with dorado, tuna and other game fish. For info on dive and snorkel tours check Bajaex.com or Funbaja.com. Read more on Baja and La Paz.
And weird works for this indie garage quintet. The title comes from the bands observations of others' false perceptions that their personal interactions through social media are as intimate as they think. Said Pete, the “obvious purpose of music has been to address life, and provide it with a voice, music allows you to escape reality, or address it,” which this album does.
Earlier this month, police arrested the man who allegedly threw the punch that decked Bounan. The man, Aaron Jacob Parsons, 20, is a party promoter from Rosedale. He is being held on $500,000 bail on charges of assault and robbery.
But Romney's own campaign tactics have greatly contributed to the ugly atmosphere of the GOP race. He's won his three biggest primaries -- in Florida, Michigan and, very narrowly, Ohio -- by beating his challengers to a pulp with unrelenting negative campaign tactics, fueled by a massive financial edge.
According to the mayor's proposed 2010 budget, letting go of the workers will save under $2 million, but new money has not been identified in the budget to hire outside contractors.
Today, with the Lombardi Trophy sitting next to him on a table as he addressed the media, everyone wanted to know if he’d go out on top after winning another Super Bowl.

Thus, Ben's alarmism about having to "cast their consciences aside" or "go out of business"  is nonsense. As is his worry about cost. It is more cost-effective to cover prevention than the cost of unintended pregnancy and newborn care.

Murphy's approach helps explain how Denali Marketing, a loyalty marketing agency founded in 2006, ranked first among the 45 small companies in the Star Tribune's 100 Top Workplaces 2010. It also may have something to do with the recession-defying growth of the company, whose clients include Best Buy and Sun Country Airlines.
This is not a new tactic. During the 1990s, Congress refused to appropriate full transportation funding, which made the federal books look slightly more balanced but contributed to the deterioration of road quality nationwide. And, as study after study has shown, regular maintenance saves far more money over the long haul than the start-and-stop policies that have afflicted road policy and now are taking a toll on smaller harbors.
In the Monarch district in west St. Louis County, incumbent and Board President Rick Gans of Chesterfield lost an ugly re-election fight against newcomer Steven O. Swyers, of Wildwood. Swyers beat Gans by a healthy margin, garnering 53 percent of the vote.

A Mayer pal says they still could reconcile: "He never ends things with a clean slate. He likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good."
When I think of a one-person show, I think of war heroes, cancer survivors, or Jimmy Carter or the Dalai Lama -- people who've done something incredible. Or someone who's famous worldwide and we're interested in their past because of that. Like, "Oh, wow -- Madonna had hammertoes!?"
With the number of home runs, the father can see his son's growth. Keith is not tall, standing just under 5 feet 2. But he has a slugger's swing. Two home runs the first year, eight the next, then 26, 53, 97 and 94 so far into their private season.

Across the back of the exhibit is a large replica of the bridge of the Enterprise. Yep, you can sit in a version of Capt. James T. Kirk's command chair. I've long thought that one of our studio-driven theme parks should re-create TV and movies sets for folks to browse through, such as the "Cheers" bar or the "Bewitched" living room.
Government employment fell by 12,000 as private sector jobs added 212,000. Lower property values translate into lower assessments with considerable lag in most communities, and in 2013, the housing recession will dramatically reduce local tax receipts and employment. Coupled with federal budget cutbacks, government employment should fall by about 20,000 a month through the end of 2012.

The face transplant team collaborated with the Living Legacy Foundation of Maryland, the organ and tissue donation program serving most of Maryland. The Office of Naval Research has awarded the university grants to study transplants in the hope that the procedures can be used for military patients.
"There cannot be process for the sake of process. There has to be a timeline. If Assad continues as he has, to fail to end the violence, to institute a cease-fire, to withdraw his troops from the areas he has been battering ... then it’s unlikely he is going to ever agree," she said. "Because it is a clear signal that he wants to wait to see if he has totally suppressed the opposition. I think he would be mistaken to believe that. My reading is that the opposition is gaining in intensity, not losing."

At Seaton Hackney, Schumacher said, "What we like to do, and, I believe, are very good at, is take a rank beginner rider and bring that young aspiring equestrian safely and efficiently to a point where that rider can decide whether or not upper level competition is in her/his future, be it in Dressage, CT (combined training) or HJ (hunter/jumper). When that time comes, we will saddly but understandingly "surrender" that adequately prepared rider to the fancier -- and more expensive -- facilities whose main purpose is to take their riders to shows."

Credit-ratings firm Moody's warned Monday that a "weaker commitment to fiscal discipline" in the Netherlands could put "downward pressure" on the country's triple-A rating.

His feelings run so high, so close to the surface, that it wasn't entirely a joke. Only a month ago, he and his wife Angie adopted their first child, Caleb. Everybody loves Watson, a natural-born blubberer. He wears his emotions on his sleeve, except when they slip down to his wrist. He cries if his eggs are cooked right."

"Grey Gardens" -- May 26-June 21, 2009, main stage. "A third musical?," Coleman posed the question to himself. "Yes, I've lost my mind." But it's an intriguing musical, to be sure. Based on the 1975 cult-classic documentary of the same title, "Grey Gardens" follows the dysfunctional mother-daughter relationship of a pair of Jackie Kennedy's eccentric relatives as their lives decay from aristocratic grace to squalid isolation, from American royalty to the queens of crazy cat ladies. It's 2006-07 Broadway run earned several Tony nominations.

We came to Amsterdam as the first leg of a trip through Germany because I had always wanted to visit the Anne Frank House and to see the canals, and this seemed our best chance.

Dietary control of hyperthyroidism is our new option. In order for this mode of treatment to be effective, the feline patient must eat Prescription Diet y/d exclusively. This means no treats, table food, or sneaking into other pet's bowls. Prescription Diet y/d comes in both canned and dry forms. It works by limiting the amount of iodine in the diet. Iodine is needed by the thyroid gland to produce hormone, so production is restricted when there is very little iodine available, and the gland is unable to be overactive.

When I first started traveling to Mexico, lodging choices veered between humble homegrown pensions or rather dingy motels and the massive El Presidente, Fiesta Americana and similar hotel chains. There was virtually nothing in the middle. As more comfortable, well-run but still small and locally owned inns and small hotels sprung up, they weren't always easy to find.

At first he considered opening a counseling center to help people deal with loss. His focus changed after he met Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, the Swiss-born psychiatrist whose 1969 bestseller "On Death and Dying" lifted the taboo in the medical community on discussions of dying.

4. Place the burgers on the hot grate and season again with salt and pepper. Grill the burgers until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium. If desired, rotate the burgers 90 degrees halfway through cooking each side for an attractive crosshatch of grill marks. If using cheese and/or pancetta, place a slice of each on each burger after you've flipped it, pancetta first. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer through the side of the burger into the center, letting the temperature reach 160 degrees for medium.

Like many PUDs proposed in the last several years, this one involves a relatively small piece of land without the mixed uses that characterized the expansive projects that were among the first built under these rules in Baltimore County, including Mays Chapel and Owings Mills Town Center.

One other factor worked to Obama's and McCain's benefit during the primary season -- a deepening distrust among voters of all ideological stripes toward the Washington political hierarchy. McCain first attempted to run as the candidate of his party's establishment and failed dismally in that effort. It was only after his near-death experience last year that he reverted to the role of outsider and underdog that he began his comeback. Obama's positioning was even more impressive, as he successfully recast Hillary Clinton's message of experience as the ultimate in conventional and traditional politics. Almost one year after the fact, it's still extraordinary to realize that the first plausible female candidate in our nation's history was dismissed as business as usual.
Those words uttered before the fourth quarter turned prophetic in the Lakers' 114-106 double-overtime victory. Although Durant finished the game with 35 points, Ebanks played a large part in holding him to five in the quarter, none in the first overtime, and only 11-of-34 shooting for the day.

She insisted the changes would help ease an unfair burden placed on farmers and ranchers who were once pushed by the government itself to clear the rainforest. Beginning in the 1960s, land was given away as long as 50 percent of a plot was cleared. Other incentives didn't end until the 1990s.
Sentiment for two of Broadway's departed eminences didn't translate into golden medallions. There were no awards for August Wilson's "Radio Golf," the last chapter in his 10-play cycle about the African American experience in the 20th century; he finished it shortly before his death in 2005. And the dearth of prizes for "Curtains," first seen last year at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, meant that lyricist Fred Ebb, who died in 2004, and librettist Peter Stone, who had died the previous year, received no posthumous Tony honors. Composer John Kander, Ebb's partner on hits such as "Cabaret" and "Chicago," completed the show with Rupert Holmes.

CARNEY: Again, as I just stated, the President is committed to working with Congress. We actually hope and expect that there will be many opportunities this year to achieve things with Congress on behalf of the American people, specifically to help grow the economy and create jobs. That would include extending the payroll tax cut as well as unemployment insurance for the full calendar year. It will include, we hope, taking up other measures of the American Jobs Act that did not pass but which have traditionally received bipartisan support.

The results way back then were similar to those we have all experienced — at least those of us who have ever used film. “One man,” Fisher recorded, “had purchased film for 100 exposures and had gone on a long and interesting trip through Europe, kodaking as he went.

Just about every rationale offered for the peripheral canal  which would be the largest water project in the state since the Aqueduct was completed four decades ago  is hotly contested.

And this year, like Dee Hart last year, athletes are starting to force the hands of college recruiters. And who can blame them. Recruits are the livelihood of NCAA coaches and their job security. When a coach making a million dollars a season wants to make an investment in his career, he wants to take out the guesswork.
Still, there is the question of political optics, which has annoyed even some liberal critics. Obama will be resting and recreating on an island associated with the wealthy (though not everyone there is) at a time when unemployment has remained at 9.1 percent and how the administration has handled economic issues remains the heart of U.S. politics and policy through 2012 and probably beyond.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein nicely summed up the GOP’s strange behavior to The New York Times: “This is part of a larger effort, candidly, to cut back on rights and services to women. We’ve seen it go from discussions on Roe v. Wade, to partial birth abortion, to contraception, to preventive services for women. This seems to be one more thing.”
Lord died in 2002 and his grave is in Green Mount Cemetery, where other famous Baltimoreans -- including Johns Hopkins, John Wilkes Booth and Enoch Pratt -- rest.

The opera's plot was inspired by the failed real-life experiments of a lunatic Russian geneticist, Ilya Ivanov, who tried to cross-breed humans and apes. The prologue sets up the tale of the rise and fall of Orango, a.k.a. "Jean Or," a human-ape hybrid who becomes a virulent anti-communist and newspaper baron through a combination of sleazy journalism, stock exchange swindles and ruthless blackmail, before his corrupted humanity causes him to revert back to his bestial nature. He is then put in a cage and displayed as a cautionary tale.
2364 Pontchartrain Dr, $100,000
This gives the Bears a more-than-solid defensive front anchored by Julius Peppers on one side and Mercilus – the burgeoning prospect out of Illinois – on the other. He may not be a right-away difference maker, but over time, in that scheme, he could be very dangerous. Look for the Bears to also be exploring a WR (Kendall Wright, Baylor).
Yet any seed fee, at its essence a voluntary sales tax on a specific group, remains a hard sell. Some fiscal conservatives don't like the idea of any new taxes. And some birders say seed, which can run from $10 to $40 for a 20-pound bag, is already too expensive.

CHICAGO — A former Iowa letter carrier accused of sending dud pipe bombs to investment advisers called himself to the witness stand Thursday, apologized for his shaky grasp of the law and delivered his own closing in an often bizarre spectacle where he spoke about himself in the third person.
The Bybees are contented residents of Grand Court, a senior living complex at 119th Street and Lamar Avenue in Overland Park, except for one thing:
øOf course, everyone knows intuitively that structures located near rivers are subject to flooding. But many area small businesses some distance away from the river never considered that they might need flood insurance. So, very few were prepared the day the rains came and the sewers backed up in several communities, causing flooding and destruction beyond belief.
By unfortunate comparison, the 26-story residential buildings at 5601 and 5701 Boulevard East in town currently provide 318 parking spaces at five lots, restricted to those building's residents. In order to park there, residents must obtain and display an Overlook Terrace vehicle sticker. Yet there is no law or penalty that I am aware of that prevents these motorists from parking on the street.

Women were leading forces in labor strikes that began in 2006 and became the seeds for the uprising that toppled Mubarak. They have choked on tear gas and died in the streets with men. The problem, women say, is extending the equality between the sexes that was so pointed in Tahrir Square to everyday public life, where the passions of revolution give way to the restrictions of culture and tradition.
The state pension code was revised in 1998 to make employees of statewide teachers unions eligible for inflated public pensions if they already had service credits in the plan — just like the Chicago-area labor leaders who benefited from city public pension funds.

I would like to say this is a new phenomenon, but I'm sure it isn't. The ancient Romans actually killed losing gladiators sometimes, a punishment that even Alabama fans would find harsh. And I imagine that if you went back millions of years, you would have heard the following conversation:
The time for optimism had ended. It was now a time for pragmatism. Spring had come to an end. Which is why Cashman paced around in and out of the clubhouse, looking for the players he would trade, send down, or call up before the end of the business day.

Other adult items were equally enticing. We began with the signature Tomaydo basil soup ($4.25), rich and creamy with a sweet edge, topped with fresh parmesan and bread crumbs. Salads, the restaurant's bread-and-butter so to speak, are fantastic -- and huge. The Seattle Walnut ($9.49) -- grilled chicken, Granny Smith apples, gorgonzola, tomatoes, walnuts and dried cherries, topped with Tomaydo's own champagne vinaigrette -- was a flawless pairing of a sweet and savory.

In fact, few Ohio members of Congress felt the need to send out press releases to publicly denounce the bombing plot that was revealed on Tuesday. The only one we got that day was from Toledo Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who congratulated the Federal Bureau of Investigation on its "exemplary work" in foiling the conspiracy.
But Senate Minority Leader Mike Hewitt, R-Walla Walla, argued that his efforts to get the House Democratic budget writer and the Senate Republican budget writer in face-to-face meetings were ignored, "so we made the move by doing a second budget."

But there was more to it, says Susan Stroman, the multiple Tony Award-winner ("The Producers," "Contact") who is directing and choreographing the musical.
“Ultimately, if we are unable to find Kyron, this could turn into a cold case,” Staton acknowledged. “At some point I’m going to have to make a final decision that this has got to move in a different direction. But right now the way I’ve got it set up, and the way I’ve been working with investigators and the FBI, the other agencies, we will downscale appropriately based on their availability (and) the funding sources.”
Rangel, who has said he didn't want his ethics case to damage fellow Democrats, said of Levin, "It's the best thing for the country, the Congress and the committee under the circumstances. I love him. He's good. He's thorough. He's got a reputation, and he'll do us well."
Leonard said he was surprised to read questions raised about the contract in Turner's letter, asking why Turner or Vasquez didn't come to him if they had such concerns.

Wheaton North is streaming football games and other activities through an Internet service called iHigh, which allows the school to sell commercial time and advertising space to local businesses.
Another highlight of our Funchal trip – rating right up there with swimming in the warm ocean – was taking the telefrico (sky cable car) from the heart of Funchal up to the village of Monte, which offers astounding views and – surprise! – a toboggan ride down steep streets. No, there's no snow; these toboggans have greased wooden runners and two guides whose thick boots help slow down the sleds for the sharp turns. The sleds travel a few kilometers, and riders can then take a taxi back up the hill or down to Funchal. For the not-so-adventurous, it's still worth the trip up to Monte – and the extra few euros to take the cable car back down.

Another was her recent arena concert tour, a conceptually ambitious production that presented not just a cavalcade of her hits and album tracks to tens of thousands of fans each night, but a show that took them inside the head, heart and imagination of a typical teenage girl, warts and all. (She'll headline a world tour next year that's scheduled to include 85 shows in 18 countries.)
"I have had a year to put this letter together and am still at a loss for words," Debbie Brumback said.
The surveys, which involved more than 1,200 companies, suggest that some businesses feel they will be better off dropping health insurance coverage once the exchanges start, even though they could face fines and tax headaches. The percentage of companies that are already saying they expect to do this surprised some experts, and if they follow through, it could start a trend that chips away at employer-sponsored health coverage, a long-standing pillar of the nation's health system.
6. Please give me a straw if I order a drink.
Nutrition: High in Vitamins A and C, watermelon has more of the antioxidant lycopene than tomatoes (that's what gives the flesh its red color).
Nonetheless, those districts are still legally obligated to provide transportation for students who need it, which is often more than half the student population of any given school, and sometimes far more. Highland Community School District buses about 2,300 of its 3,000 students, officials say. At Cahokia, about 90 percent of the district's 4,200 students are bused.

"For as long as I can remember, I just knew that I was going to be on the stage. I don't know how that happened but I just always knew that," she said. "I would love to do more theater. I would love to do TV, I would love to do movies, I would love to do commercials. As long as I stay in the performing arts zone I'm happy."
At the very least, take some interest. That's all that many young job seekers are asking.
"Avoiding the issue, as seems to have been taking place in the last couple of weeks, does not work," Wilf said. "It only gets more difficult and more expensive. We're very encouraged by leadership of both houses and the governor in trying to bring a stadium solution front and center."

She is interested in the pre-med program to possibly study and work in the field of neonatology. Pankowski, who is a 4.0 student, has found the keys to time management at an early age.
Ignite's rooftop scene is on par with the upper decks at nearby hangouts like LoDo's and the Tavern Uptown. The difference, though, is size: Ignite is considerably smaller. The building is a modest two-story affair, not low-slung and sprawling, so the roof is just not as spacious. Ignite does a good job with what it has, though, including plenty of four-tops, some shaded high-boys and seating at the bar.
The bill passed in December in the then-Democratic-controlled House, but was blocked in the Senate by a 55-41 vote, with most Republicans and a few Democrats saying the measure would reward illegal behavior.

"You can't cost-cut your way to revenues," Russo said.
"You've got to stay disciplined because they have a good power play. At the same time, we're not going to back down. We haven't backed down from anyone all year. We'll continue to play physical, and we anticipate they will do the same. That's playoff hockey for you. We've just got to stick together and just play the right way, which is how we've been doing it all year."

What kind of organization shuts down a whistleblower's claims, bankrupts him with a $1.2 million order and then can't find the testimony behind its damning decision?
At 3 1/2 hours, Martin Scorsese's bio-doc of the Quiet Beatle may seem like a lot, but it covers a whole life -- and it was a hell of a life. There are interviews with Harrison's brothers, wives, son and the surviving Beatles, oceans of never-before-seen footage, and deep insights into the man's musical and spiritual journeys. There are blemishes and contradictions on display: This is no hagiography. Scorsese, who did a similarly fine job on Bob Dylan in "No Direction Home," manages to make us see a familiar figure anew. Harrison was a saintly fellow of his stripe, and the obvious love and loss his friends feel at his absence is poignant. A lovely and, I dare say, definitive portrait.
“I wanted to call Jackie Leary,” Menino said yesterday. “He was the first person I thought about from the moment I heard about the crime. I wanted to pick up the phone and hear Jackie’s voice telling me what the situation was.”
The climactic scene set to Queen's "Under Pressure" is so soaring and grandiose I have no problem deeming it "Fantasia"-worthy.

"The kid can throw," Trapp said of Spanberger. "We're going to have to be on top of our game ... It's going to be a grind, but hopefully we can get on the board right away and take them out of their game plan a little. It's hard to beat a good team three times. Their record may not be great, but they're a pretty good team."

The other thing that stood out to me is how the group mimicked the stats concerning future employment. The vast majority of survivors I met are unemployed or were doing volunteer work even if they had paid employment before their accidents. Although the largest group of TBI survivors is young adults in their prime working years, including many of today's returning soldiers, many survivors do not return to work. The ability to work is highly connected to the executive brain functions the survivor has left. This is one of the reasons high costs are associated with brain injuries and why some caregivers of the severely brain injured have a heavy load.
Jay Perman feels a touch ashamed now of the thoughts he had when he first started seeing droplets of fat in the livers of adolescent patients.

Educating new doctors is a decade-long process, from medical school to internships and or residency programs. Congress foolishly placed a cap on funding for residency programs, provided by Medicare, back in 1997, and the number of residency slots has not increased since then.
In the first game, which was suspended in the fourth inning on Tuesday, 3B Andy LaRoche (.172) and LaPorta homered, but the bullpen gave up six runs in 61/3 innings.
What's behind the delay? The first time Medical Mutual calculated the new rate, the federal government rejected it because they had problems with the "increases that were indicated based on the market modeling," Haughawout said.
An interim review by Edwards' supervisor concluded: "I cannot overstate the degree to which I respect Ms. Edwards and her work with this unit."
"I think it would have been better to use stronger language and explicitly state that sponsors should be prohibited from forcing a J-1 worker to remain on a job if they have legitimate complaints, or from threatening the J-1 with program termination if they don't remain on the job," he said.

"GCB": Robert Harling, the writer of "Steel Magnolias," is the executive producer of this show featuring another group of colorful, opinionated Southern women and their Dallas community. Leslie Bibb plays Amanda, who was a teenage Mean Girl in her Dallas days but then moved away. The death of her husband forces Amanda to come back to Big D with her tail between her legs and move her kids in with her mother (played by Annie Potts). Amanda's re-entry into the community isn't going to be easy because the women she knew back when are carrying grudges, not to mention their own baggage. The debut episode is lively and funny, though it's as broad as a barn door when it comes to characterizing these women and their world. Kristin Chenoweth also stars. (10 p.m., ABC/2)
Some conservative reformers argue that No Child Left Behind established an "accountability framework" that's worth preserving. Trouble is, the federal law created incentives for states to dumb down rather than raise standards in order to reach that all-important 100 percent proficiency by 2014.

The widespread expectation in Springfield is that the General Assembly could nibble around the edges of the big issues this spring, doing just enough to tell voters back home they did their best but leaving the more difficult decisions until after the November election.

He said Dominion has been a "good corporate neighbor," despite what he characterized as "minor" complaints from neighboring residents about noise generated by the terminal's facilities.

I was the beneficiary of having outstanding teachers from elementary throughout college and graduate school to the point where I'm still thinking about the things they taught me. I hope that as they've created in myself the desire to be a lifelong learner, I hope to instill in my students these same level of learning to hopefully supersede the level of instruction I was fortunate enough to receive from these teachers.

This was an idea that was supported by a strong majority of the American people -- including nearly half of Republicans. The majority of millionaires supported it. And Senate Republicans didn’t listen. They refused to even let it come up for a vote; refused to ask the wealthiest among us to do their fair share. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House just signaled their willingness to gut programs like this one that make a real difference in people’s lives -- thousands of middle-class families or folks who are trying to get into the middle class.

Fontbonne's softball team looks well on its way to a fourth straight 20-win season. The Griffins (12-6) have used an explosive offense to trigger much of their early-season success, led by the hot bats of freshmen Danielle Glixman (Parkway North) at .422 and Cassandra Glixman (Parkway North) at .396. Danielle Glixman is fourth on the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference batting list.

Yet it's the continuing nuclear crisis that especially haunts this man in his 60s. That's because he's a survivor of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima in the final stages of World War II. A buff, square-jawed fellow, Mokudai appears the picture of health. But he's endured cancer and other afflictions attributed to the Aug. 6, 1945, nuclear blast that instantly killed an estimated 90,000-120,000 people and caused the deaths of tens of thousands more.

He did say our rain is unconnected to El Niño or global warming or Icelandic volcanoes or a butterfly fluttering its wings in China.
Police and city officials maintain there is no gang problem and that identifying gang members -- who they say may or may not be active -- needlessly frightens the public. "We go after the criminals," said Elizabeth Police Chief Ronald Simon. "If they're selling drugs, if they're committing acts of violence, that is how they come in contact with us. That's how we react to them, that is how we arrest them. If they happen to be identified as gang members so be it."

After a shocking early exit in last year's NCAA Tournament, Baylor may be the most redemption-hungry team in this year's field and it clearly shows. Opponents have tried everything to slow down Brittney Griner — some almost mirroring a defense one might see against Dwight Howard and the Orlando Magic, with up to four defenders collapsing on the 6-8 center at once — but the Bears have comfortably sidestepped the field just like they have during an undefeated regular season. The one thing that the Cardinal may have going for them is the high rate at which they score. Coming into this game Stanford ranks fifth in scoring offense, buoyed by the fantastic Nnemkadi Ogwumike, who averaged 34 points, 9.5 rebounds and hit 67.6 percent from the field last weekend. Their best chance will be to turn this into a shootout.

Investigators would find a .22-caliber handgun in his backpack. It was a crucial find, since ballistic tests would later confirm that a weapon of the same caliber was used in the Jan. 26 murder of Phoenix cigar salesman Bruce Gaudet, whose body was found in his smoldering condo, and the Jan. 30 murders of philanthropists Lawrence and Glenna Shapiro, whose bodies also were found amid the remnants of an arson fire at their Paradise Valley home.

You know an artist is at work when you look into the palatial space at the back of the cavernous dining room; it's the French Laundry of Japanese kitchens. The 3,500-square-foot room sits under a curved glass-enclosed lounge that looks as if it came from "Star Trek," glowing in shades of deep blue and soft lavender. Kamio stations himself at a counter front and center, framed by a black metal grid and surrounded by more than 30 white-coated cooks. A stand of knives, a collection of chopsticks and at least a dozen perfectly aligned garnishes in bowls are all tools he uses to put the finishing touches on the dishes.

We also approached the woman who cuts their hair. I went in and said to people: My daughter had a melt down over ice cream because she wanted more. And, so I decided my children needed to meet people they didn't know and learn about their lives, so they can develop an appreciation for other people in their community as well as their own lives. The hair dresser said to us, "I always ask clients about them; no one asks about me." She was a single mom, divorced, raising three kids on her own. And that day was her daughter's birthday, and she was at work. I told my girls, I'm home with you guys on your birthdays. Do you see she can't even be with her daughter on her special day? They really got it.
I'm collaborating again with Mark Annen, who helped design Park Kitchen. To me the design highlight is the physical connection between the bar counter and the open kitchen. It emphasizes the close connection between the food and drinks we will be serving.
Crawford watched from the bench as Ray Emery played the last two games, but will man the crease as he looks to snap the Hawks' six-game losing streak and a personal four-game skid.
D.H.: My "low-tech" wife tried all the ones you mentioned and more, and failed. Couldn't learn how to use the darn things." He said she finally checked out the "Doro" phone by Consumer Cellular and "loves it," partly because of how easy it is to use.

It didn't happen again after that night in 1982 but Hickson's abuse of Starr continued for years. He kept her off World Championship and Commonwealth Games squads, even though she was faster than members of the teams, because she refused his continued sexual advances.
Carp has only pitched six complete seasons as a Cardinal, so his standing on the franchise leaderboards isn't all that impressive. But in terms of impact, he's up there with the best. He's the only Cardinal pitcher in history to make starts in four different postseasons. He's one of only three to be the ace for two World Champions; the others are Bob Gibson and Mort Cooper. He's one of only four to have 1,000 or more strikeouts; the others are Gibson, Bob Forsch, and Dizzy Dean. He's the only Cardinal other than Gibson to win a Cy Young award (although, to be fair, Dean, Cooper, and Howie Pollet probably would have won it if the award had existed back when they pitched). And Carpenter is the only Cardinal ever to get at least one 1st-place vote in the Cy voting in three different seasons (2005, 2006, and 2009). Not even Gibson did that.
Wright was released with a pending court date.
Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, sounded increasingly optimistic.

In his tune-up start for Toledo on Saturday night, Smyly allowed three runs and exited in the second inning. He had thrown 50 pitches, and club officials might have decided that was plenty to get him ready for his debut Thursday against Tampa Bay.
A: Spare tires, even the compact temporary type, are disappearing from many cars and crossovers as manufacturers try to save weight, space and money. Lucky for you, though, full-size spares remain available on several SUVs.
Occupy St. Louis member Zach Chasnoff mentioned in his remarks on the steps in front of the Peabody Energy building that the corporation should return some of the tax breaks it has received, including $2 million from St. Louis Public Schools, so those funds can better benefit the city.
Barrett said Friday's incident wasn't the first time someone had mistaken a partner for a turkey and shot him twice.
The bar's cocktails are sophisticated - no gimmicky flavored vodkas here - and a portion of the menu is dedicated, fittingly, to variations on blood and sand. We tried the classic, aptly named Blood & Sand ($10; scotch, orange juice, sweet vermouth, cherry liqueur), a well-balanced cocktail that's citrusy and sweet with a gentle kick from the scotch and bitters. And the Bleeding Castro ($10; rum, spicy-sweet vermouth, orange juice, grapefruit juice, cherry liqueur, bitters) was much more potent but still smooth.
The amici briefs question why the trial-court jury was allowed to hear the problematic identification of Lawson as the shooter by Sherl Hilde, the victim's widow, who was critically injured in the brutal late-night sniper incident at Briggs Camp.

Though Adamek has fought 45 times in his career — and, after a unanimous decision victory against Kevin McBride (35-9-1), won 44 of those fights — he has done so as a heavyweight just six times.
Even though Esther had wed in secret, her father later threw the customary party at home. Her family begged Esther to delay her departure, she was so young, this was so sudden. And while Larry was polite and shy, her father worried. Esther simply said she was Larry's wife now. She would cross an ocean and a continent to be with him.
Police did not comment on whether the attack was random or whether items were stolen from the shop.
Cain was perfect the first time through the order, throwing just 28 pitches. But the Marlins struck in the fourth when Jose Reyes walked, stole second, took third on a wild pitch and strolled home on Hanley Ramirez's single through a drawn-in infield.

Scott was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1992 when that city erupted into violence after a jury acquitted four L.A. police officers -- three white and one Hispanic -- accused in the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. Scott recalls walking out of The Forum on April 29 after a playoff game and into the "chaos."
The 22-year-old certainly didn't damage his case against the A's, allowing just one run on a pair of singles and two walks, striking out seven. He's now 8-5 with a 2.58 ERA. Those are pretty good numbers for anybody, let alone a youngster in his first big league tour.
State Republican Chairman Jay Webber wished the 86-year-old Senator a "speedy recovery."

With the new bar, I'm thinking they might need to tweak the name. Maybe the Wilde Roast Cafe & Bar? "I hadn't really thought about that," Schlaak said. "But I suppose we should add something so we can get the word out."
Greg Cote, Miami Herald: "I'm not sure what will be worse to see: Seattle's hideous home uniforms or a pathetic Rams offense that could be down to third-string QB Tom Brandstater because of injuries to Sam Bradford and A.J. Feeley that kept this game mercifully off the gambling sheets. St. Lose is 1-5 on the road, and Seattle has had extra time to prepare after playing last Thursday and has won 12 of past 13 in this series."

In other words, those involved have done a great disservice to their colleagues — men and women who are willing to take a bullet for the president, the first family and others they’re sworn to protect. Their behavior also evoked the issue of human trafficking and its intimate link to prostitution — which is why the State Department prohibits its employees from patronizing prostitutes even in countries, like Colombia, where it is legal.

It’s hard to appreciate his particular craft, but it was easy to notice that this guy did his job as well as anyone during the annihilation of Atlanta. Most of us tend to think his world spins on power, distance and hang time, but the finesse and accuracy Weatherford demonstrated Sunday completely locked up the Falcons’ return game, and coach Tom Coughlin made a point of noticing.
A year ago, Twins right-hander Matt Capps made him look beaten on an inside fastball. A year later, the 37-year-old Jeter is making fools of those who try.

The alliance contacted about 300 former patients from American hospitals throughout 2006 and parts of 2007. The number was higher for larger hospitals.

There are still people out there who believe the Social Security trust fund contains economic assets that can be used to pay for benefit checks. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, for example, says no action on Social Security is needed until two decades from now. If so, why was it necessary for Treasury to transfer cash to Social Security to cover its costs? Why didn't the feds simply dip into the trust fund, stashed with $2.6 trillion in Treasury bonds?

A diplomat who worked both sides of the aisle, Udall finessed the Wilderness Act by invoking not the social programs of FDR but the national park initiatives of Teddy Roosevelt. He shrewdly drew attention to the growth of the Sierra Club and the popular awareness of the environment that had been sparked by Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" and, to a lesser extent, his own Wallace Stegner-inspired "The Quiet Crisis," about the history of America's environmental movement. The legislation, coupled with other laws, has made the Udall years at Interior the historical high-water mark for preservation and conservation. The Wilderness Act, said one ardent supporter, turned poetry into policy.
"When Lily met my mother, she picked up certain Norwegian Christmas traditions, such as the potato-pancake thing called lefse, a jellied pork-and-veal thing called sylte, and various kinds of Christmas cookies, including something my mother called Chinese chews," said Charles Fillmore, a retired Cal linguistics professor who, like his wife, still lectures, writes and does research.

"The nice part is, if they have a bad period, they're able to regroup quickly, We don't have to go through the dance where maybe it's a week where he's a poor player. Maybe it's a period, and they jump right back. I like that in them, the fact that they respond that way."

It may sound modest, but plant Superintendent Mike Henderson calls the hirings a "significant pickup." The plant's 50 employees produce thin layers of veneer, which are trucked to Medford and pressed together to make plywood and beams used in housing and other construction. No one is calling it a boom, but a slow rebound from the recession may be unfolding in the decimated wood products industry. That's why the company replaced the retired workers and approved the new hires.

Brown, 55, went to Omaha specifically to speak out against an anti-discrimination ordinance that extends rights to gay, lesbian and transgender people. This was part of his three-minute speech that's available on YouTube: The question I have for all of you, like Pontius Pilate, what are you going to do with Jesus? Ultimately, if you don't have a relationship with him, and you don't really have a Bible-believing mentality, really, anything goes. At the end of the day, it matters what God thinks most.
Obama, addressing the National Governors Association, said he supports a move to let states design their own health care systems starting in 2014 with waivers from provisions of his 2010 Affordable Care Act, so long as those state systems meet the law's goals.

And it's the home to a mysterious black-leafed, white-veined plant growing in a forest near the high school. This undocumented flora attracts an outsider: "Professor" Paulie Panther, a participatory botanist whose job is updating "an encyclopedia of the hallucinogenic effects of North American plantlife." Panther is, quite simply, one of the great messed-up antiheros of recent fiction, at once a man on a mission and the most chemically addled weirdo this side of Hunter S. Thompson. (With his sideburns and intense scowl, he actually looks more the way the late Harvey Pekar sometimes did in his "American Splendor" comics.) The first of many laugh-out-loud moments for me came during the prelude: An incredulous motel manager asks why he needs a receipt, to which Panther — cigarette smoke blooming, mirror shards stuck in his forehead, blood flowing down his face — responds: "I'm here on business."

He's from Texas. He moved to Cleveland in March. Something to do with tequila? Nope. Venzor came to Cleveland thinking he was going to attend law school. That is, until he ditched it for another kind of bar -- one in which he serves chocolate-based drinks. "I don't know many people here or much about Cleveland," says Venzor. He also can't speak about the drinks at Chocolate Bar. Not because he doesn't know much about them. "I'm sworn not to divulge the recipes," he says. "They're a secret."
He said he was surprised the court let the CityNorth agreement stand, "but I understand that with two decades of confusion, overturning it could have opened a Pandora's box" of challenges.
I'd say, lots of luck on that one . . . with most places, but not here.
One can easily understand why some of us have decided to literally "occupy" various entities.
The Magic of Belle Isle
I wrote a note about this back in April for the Sunday feature, Hot Corner:
Jay Hancock's recent column regarding speed camera was simply shameful (Welcome to Md., becoming known as the 'Speed Trap State,'" Dec. 13). So we enforce our laws — big deal. So he and the poor man from out-of-state were fined for exceeding the speed limit (by more than a few miles per hour). There is an easy way to avoid that: Obey the law. Drive at the appropriate and safe speed. (I'm glad Mr. Hancock briefly mentioned the almost forgotten point that the speed limits exist for safety.)

"Are you raising your child to be a farmworker?" asks Tom Nassif, president of the Western Growers Association, which represents growers in California and Arizona.

Because the rail authority approved the new business plan last week, the LAO, watchdog groups and some legislators have warned that the changes are coming too quickly for them to approve the massive project by the June deadline to pass a budget.

A few years later, when Dre's mother, Kim, forbade him from joining a team, Charles gave in to his son's pleadings and sneaked him off to Little League practice for a month.

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the main application for most federal aid programs. It determines a family’s ability to pay for college based on the previous year’s tax information.

But that's not what the moment calls for. That's not what we came here to do. We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape it. I still believe we can act even when it's hard. I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress. I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet history's test.
"What you have here is a very inspiring group who have moved mountains, and at varying stages could have retired, but we missed building something," Rogers said. "So we sort of found each other.

"Dante in Love" certainly shouldn't replace another volume in your personal library of Dante-related books, but it does make a fine contribution to our appreciation of a poet who, as 19th century historian Jacob Burckhardt wrote, "absorbed the whole world into his own soul." So read Wilson's book, pick up that copy of the "Commedia" and try again.

Montclair artist Peter Jacobs has been keeping track of our times by turning them into a collage — he cuts out images from a newspaper with an X-Acto blade and glues them into Strathmore sketchbooks, creating remarkably integrated original images composed by sight (there are no computer algorithms choosing and shaping his work). From May 4 to July 1, he’ll be showing excerpts from the 2,555 collages he’s made over the past few years in “Changing Times: Seven Years of the Collage Journal.”

His jaw seems to chew his repetitive wheedling demands, half-formed ideas and excuses like a cud. His wide eyes are forever roving and retreating, baffled by the clutter, in their attempts to find something to use for his advantage. His scheming is as patent as it is muddled in his attempts to turn one brother against the other. A wonderfully expressive thumb or forefinger completes the thoughts for which he can't find words.

However, it would enhance California's status as a high-tax state. And we can't know in advance whether raising marginal tax rates on those in upper income tiers would have an indirect effect of damaging the state competitiveness for job-producing investment, or of encouraging those targeted for higher taxes to relocate to a no-income tax state such as Nevada.

What struck me was the caliber of the players who showed up Monday to support their teammate and a good cause. There were quarterback Joe Flacco and running back Ray Rice, two young faces of the franchise who are engaged in contract talks with the team, chatting with fans.

And there were offensive tackle Michael Oher and wide receiver Torrey Smith, who both give back as much as they can after enduring challenging upbringings, serving up steak dinners.

There are difficulties with this back-and-forth technique. Casual readers may have trouble keeping track of the dual story lines, and Czolgosz's reemergence after a 150-page absence from the text is jarring. Students of labor history will be familiar with the parade of militant actions: the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, the execution of Parsons and three other anarchist leaders after an 1886 demonstration that ended with violence in Chicago's Haymarket Square, the Homestead Steel strike of 1892 and anarchist Alexander Berkman's attempt to assassinate the man responsible for crushing it. Aficionados of more traditional history will be equally familiar with the events of the Spanish-American War, including the sinking of the Maine and George Dewey's destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila as well as the U.S. annexation of Cuba and the Philippines.

The band saved their best for the encore set. In addition to “Prayer,” and “Wanted Dead Or Alive,” they sent one out to their hardcore fans, performing the often-requested, ten-minute “Dry County,” a quasi-political peak-oil lament from 1995’s “Keep The Faith”. Much of the crowd, eager for the “Slippery When Wet” hits, waited patiently through the mid-tempo ballad – one which has sometimes been compared to “November Rain.” But those in the audience who’d seen Bon Jovi before knew they’d been given a special treat. The group was up to the challenge, and Sambora’s solo on “Dry County” was scalding.

Concerned about the high levels of lovastatin in some products, the FDA in August banned the sale of Cholestrix, a red yeast rice supplement sold by Sunburst Biorganics, and two other red yeast rice supplements sold by Swanson Health Products. The FDA reports that the levels of lovastatin found in the products could be high enough to cause kidney damage, a rare complication of statins.
While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others monitor U.S. flu patterns, they rely on lab data and doctor visits. Not lightning-fast or grass-roots accurate. We YOU Docs use Google Flu Trends, which -- based on the number of searches about flu symptoms -- spots patterns a week or two sooner than the CDC. If FluNearYou succeeds, it aims to be far more specific (we doubt anyone can beat Google's speed).

A SILVER TSUNAMI
It may be titled "A Little Journey," but Rachel Crothers' 1918 play takes on big themes: feminism, religion and class. A finalist for the first Pulitzer Prize for drama, it sometimes feels blunt and dated. But it also sparkles with incisive characterizations and sharp dialogue that reveal superb craft. The Mint Theater Company's wonderfully staged and acted revival is yet another example of its uncanny knack for ferreting out obscure theatrical gems.

But when the meal arrived, Arellano was taken aback. Instead of the beloved cactus leaves, goat stew and "stinky cheese" he'd been served since childhood by his Zacatecas-immigrant parents, he was confronted with a plate of dry rice and a glop of refried beans, laced with toxic-yellow queso and smothered in a sour-cream avalanche.

Amidst reports of their disintegrating marriage, the fifth season of their increasingly popular TLC reality show aired, and the strain on them was clearly evident: paparazzi stood at a distance and photographed their sextuplets' outdoor birthday party while Jon and Kate barely exchanged a word. It was all so riveting, 10 million of us tuned in to watch.

Walter Pilling. My German friend. I'd written about you some time ago when we went to Oktoberfest at the Phoenix Club. You used to have a Westfalia identical to mine. On Friday, you brought me a spare taillight lens, a bottle of smoked beer from Bamberg and, most precious, a custom tool you'd made for adjusting VW engine valves. You are a machinist by trade.

On the other hand, Union Station is in downtown, where you don't find a lot of free parking. And it's not too far from other major entertainment venues downtown -- Busch Stadium, Scottrade Center, the Peabody Opera House, etc. So if it did have a free parking lot, Cardinals and Blues fans might end up using it a lot (to the chagrin of other parking lot attendants around town).

Watch Harrison in the weight room, her shoulder-length blond hair pulled back in a ponytail and her face flush and bathed in sweat, and it's hard not to be impressed by her work ethic. Although she's put on more than 30 pounds in the last four years, little of that is fat, leaving her with the chiseled upper body and sculpted biceps of a middleweight boxer. That strength allows her to fight standing up and moving forward, avoiding the lazy "drop and flop" style many female judo athletes fall into.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cleveland's University Circle is world famous for its cultural, medical and educational achievements.

Folks, if you're going to do a movie about an illness - a serious one that kills lots of people every year - have respect for the people who've been through the experience. Respect their fear and suffering. Don't have Kate Hudson look more and more radiant the sicker she gets. Don't portray being battered by chemotherapy as something on the order of a hangover. "50/50" showed that it was possible to make a comedy about this subject without retreating from it. But this film is a travesty.

Diners can add white truffle oil, prosciutto or an egg for $1 each. Paired with a salad or pasta, it's a repast that's hard to beat.

What pushes THE FOURTH WAR over the top of being just a mediocre Cold War film are the leads mesmerizing performances. Scheider’s Colonel Knowles visibly teeters on the edge of sanity; his longing for a fight and near childish desire to pick on his enemy shows as plain as day on his face. Likewise, Prochnow’s Valachev is a picture perfect representation of the cold icy enemy Scheider wants to take down. His no nonsense, single-minded determination is the opposite side of the crazy coin shared by his foe. THE FOURTH WAR is an okay, fun little movie on its own, but the director and the lead actors make it something far more enjoyable and engrossing.

In this year's sequel, Trigger City (Morrow, 295 pp., $23.95) author Sean Chercover goes a little easier on his character. Dudgeon does face lies, threats and manipulation trying to find out the truth why the daughter of an Army Intelligence colonel dies.

Sadly over last few decades what we have seen is an erosion of the significance of the father's role in the family. The father is at the core of stability for a family unit, along with the mother and children. When fathers are given their proper respect and admiration, in the process we also teach our young boys what their role will be as future fathers. Fathers have the obligation to provide for the family but that is not the only "function" they serve. They act as teachers, helpers, and offer a shoulder of support during a family's tough times. In the Islamic tradition, Muslims are commanded to respect their parents: "And We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents..... Quran (46:15)

An appeal to the state Employee Relations Board would be limited. Under state statute, the three-member panel cannot determine whether the arbitrator made the right decision. Instead, the board must decide whether there are any grounds for an appeal -- for example, did the arbitrator consider all pertinent evidence, exceed her power, base the ruling on a material mistake, or did the ruling violate public policy or law?

But sniper training is a far cry from the image of lone gunmen stalking human prey that is often portrayed by Hollywood. The training is daunting. Students often spend hours moving a couple of hundred yards without being detected. They learn to pay attention to every detail.

However, another school board approved an extension for a superintendent’s contract that exceeds the cap.
Sports writers love this method. I have used it. We call coaches or friends in the basketball business and pick their brains. The problem is that they aren't much better at predicting games than we are. It's sort of like when the NFL draft rolls around, and we quote an anonymous scout saying he loves a player. Well, of course SOME scouts love the player -- that's why he got picked! It doesn't mean he is the right choice.
A raft of advertising agencies, consulting firms, pollsters, attorneys and former aides litter the list of those he owes money. He owes his former campaign manager, Michael Krull, more than $27,000. Top spokesman R.C. Hammond, who joined Gingrich at his final campaign event, is owed almost $4,000.

I did eventually meet several people who'd crossed similar lines and lived to talk about it, albeit at the price of becoming social outcasts. So it was with Aleksander Jevtic, a Serb who, in 1991, was entrusted by a Serbian officer to separate the Serbs from a throng of mostly Croatian prisoners inside a detention camp so that they could be moved to a separate area and spared from mistreatment. Jevtic proceeded to pick out more than a hundred Croats, calling them by false Serbian names. The prisoners in question were from Vukovar, his hometown.

Christie talked about closing a $2.2 billion budget deficit last year and an $11 billion deficit this year, painting Democrats as "rubbing their hands in glee" at the prospect of him having to raise taxes to fill the gap and then shocked into submission when he cut the budget instead.

Alex White's arrest last weekend was embarrassing. Both incidents were, and the players were told as much.

Is "This Will Have Been: Art, Love & Politics in the 1980s" an exhibition for people who were not alive when Reaganomics heralded a new era of luxury and disparity? When the cultural revolutions of the '60s ended their marches and started to find multiracial and female representatives finally sitting at the table? When AIDS became the most urgent rallying cry, as the radical act of same-sex love found itself ending in death and, possibly worse, indifference?
When Winter briefly flirted with retirement, he recommended as his replacement Nelson -- who also knew the triangle offense. Winter decided to keep his job, but not after Nelson and Jackson got to know one another.

And -- in a punchline -- Mullen said this behavior could warrant international sanctions. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta added that we'd "do everything we have to do to defend our forces." He did not spell out whether that meant going after the Haqqanis with U.S. special forces and/or drones, or cutting military aid. He did say "the first order of business right now is to put as much pressure on Pakistan as we can to deal with this issue from their side."

At a minimum, we need for this weekend's event to go off relatively smoothly and for all of the participants and spectators to stay safe. There's reason to believe that the event won't be marred by the kind of violence that Baltimore saw this Fourth of July, because tickets will be required for entry. Still, even a lesser incident would seriously diminish the degree to which the event serves as the promised three-hour commercial for Baltimore. We need to see downtown cleaned up and back to normal quickly, and we need to see the replacement trees event organizers promised.
"We could go into an extended cool period, which could really slow the systems down," said Linn Haramis, an entomologist with the Illinois Department of Public Health.

For the uninitiated, seeing how the Eameses lived may be a surprise. Their living room does not resemble the type of rigorously formal space that people today expect in a modern house from the era. Even though the Eames House is a wonderfully calibrated exercise in steel, glass and cement panel, the idea of replicating such formalism on the interior was anathema to its owners. If anything, their architecture is forced to take a back seat to their extraordinarily diverse collection of objects.

"White Shadow" was discovered in a collection of unidentified American nitrate prints that had been safeguarded at the New Zealand archive since 1989. That's when Tony Osborne, the grandson of New Zealand projectionist and collector Jack Murtagh, brought the highly unstable nitrate material to the archive. Because the archive only has the funding to restore its country's vintage films, experts couldn't spend much time with the American releases (though "White Shadow" was a British film it was released in the U.S. in 1924 by Lewis J. Selznick Enterprises). Selznick's son, producer David O. Selznick, would bring Hitchcock to America 15 years later to make "Rebecca."

But instead of just repeating the premise, as happened often in Season 1, the sketch grew: Armisen and Brownstein searched for the "Battlestar Galactica" scribe Ronald D. Moore, which led them to an African American Portlander named Ronald D. Moore. ("Portlandia" is still a pretty non-diverse place, so seeing actors of color was welcome.) The non-"BSG" Mr. Moore gamely offered to write some new "BSG" episodes, and it built from there, until actual "BSG" stars Edward James Olmos and James Callis showed up. And it concluded with a final joke, with the assembled group sitting down to start a new DVD-watching obsession: "Doctor Who."

—Bryant is sidelined for seven games because of a sore left shin.
She has gone on to be involved in several departments including stage management, labor operations and production coordination.
In order to make leftovers the star, it helps to have accompanists standing by. I keep some key ingredients in the kitchen that add flair to a dish, or help quickly forge a new one. Stock, for instance, can help bring moisture and flavor to already-cooked foods as you reheat them, even if they didn't contain stock in the first place, like leftover grains. Save rinds from hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, pecorinos or Gruyère, to throw into soups and stews  they add a silky, savory richness.
-- Game starts with Blake Griffin checking Joel Przybilla and DeAndre Jordan on LaMarcus Aldridge. Pretty sure tonight was Przybilla's first start since injuring his knee in Dallas in December of 2009.

The member rewards booklet puts it over the top. Even a once-a-year Vegas visitor should be able to more than make up the subscription price with this collection of 129 coupons for dining, shows, rooms and gambling.

One of the highlights is a nugget, the largest one found in California. The Mojave Nugget, at 156 troy ounces (10.8 pounds), is in the permanent collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. It was found near Randsburg in San Bernadino County in 1977, which is pretty recent and leads one to believe that there still might be a bigger one out there. Somewhere.
“I don’t think we need any more large box stores,” Coolbaugh said, “particularly on Route 1, which is going to create a tremendous traffic problem. But, I think neighborhood stores would help redevelop the neighborhood.”

"And everybody loves a deal -- that's not going to change."
Concept records that did not cohere. How about that My Chemical Romance album set in an apocalyptic wasteland? The one about the battle between superheroes and the forces of repression? Which is why they sang about... the same stuff they always sing about. Then there's Janelle Monae's Metropolis suite, which sounds great on paper, but has yet to translate to much actual sci-fi content in the songs. Clare Burson's set was supposed to be about the holocaust, or her grandmother, or European history; I listened to it ten times, trying and failing to tease the World War II narrative out of the songs. The Titus Andronicus album was advertised as a meditation on Civil War and New Jersey. Great!, but what about the Civil War and New Jersey? You can't just string together proper nouns; eventually, you either throw in a verb or you become Billy Joel in "We Didn't Start The Fire." These are all good albums -- I like them all, and I'm happy that I engaged with them. Ambition is great, and big talk is cool, and strong words in press releases do get the attention of gullible types like me. But at some point you've got to back up the blabbing with specifics; otherwise, you're just a tease, and will make me angry, and growly, and green, and poised to destroy Tokyo. Rock and roll and cola war, I can't take it anymore.

“I don’t feel any pressure this year because I know we have a lineup full of guys that are gonna hit,’’ he said. “We’ve underachieved this year as an offense, but it’s nice to have guys in the lineup you can depend on.

A satellite of a renowned braised pork foot specialty restaurant in Seoul, the ultra-obscure Koreatown spot is a nostalgic link to the steamy hole-in-the-wall jokbal joints of the motherland. Its name means Jokbal King of the Jangchung-Dong district. That enclave, as any Seoul denizen will tell you, is a paradise for jokbal buffs. There, dozens and dozens of chockablock shops boast names like Fat Grandma's Jokbal House or the Original Grandma's Jokbal (pronounced choke-bahl). Each claims to have its own "secret" braising sauce.

Trailing the Suns by two with just under six minutes left, the Blazers removed Marcus Camby and slid Nicolas Batum up the four spot, rendering Phoenix’s strategy of immediately double-teaming post-ups far more problematic. Batum promptly started raining jumpers, scoring eleven points in the final five minutes, as the Blazers used an 18-1 game-ending run to avenge last year's playoff defeat to the Suns.

"Reflections," a fireworks and fountain show, ends the night before the park closes at 10. There's seating available in Bayside Stadium, but I can't recommend sitting in the upper deck.

Brenner, Kraus and Dabrowski can envision the day when children will have a multimotored, multigrip hand capable of moving all five fingers. The technology now is limited to adults and can cost as much as $125,000, Brenner said. Children, like adults, also may want both conventional and new devices, depending on the task to be done, just the way a person may want an electric saw for one job and a manual one for something else, Brenner said.

It isn't "dependency" for the middle class to benefit from the programs that their tax dollars have financed. It is not un-American to question whether those earning many millions of dollars each year from investments should not have to pay taxes at a rate comparable to what average people see deducted from their more-meager weekly paychecks.
This was progress, and it makes you wonder why President Obama doesn't grab this opportunity, along with some of the others just lying around, and lead the way toward some sort of solution.

Luckily, bootleggers kept the vines alive in backwoods plots. The grape eventually began to make a comeback in its native Virginia thanks to Air Force pilot Dennis Horton, who grew up in Hermann and had played in the catacombs that once held casks of Stone Hill's wine. He began growing grapes in front of his house in Aroda, Va., and in 1988 asked Stone Hill to send him a shipment of Norton vines. The "Horton Norton" hit retailers' shelves in 1992.

øAnd, the opportunity to make a quick gain is usually based on an asset being undervalued. In fact, it is nearly impossible to know gold's real value.

Huggett's sound in the concerto was perfectly calibrated to present her just out front of her colleagues, putting Tartini's melodies – quick and buoyant in the outer movements, gorgeously lyric in the central Largo – in the spotlight. Part of her appeal is that she obliterates the distinction commonly made between two ways of looking at the same activity, "playing the violin" and "fiddling." Her reading of the Tartini exemplified just that, with focused discipline and exquisite cantabile expressiveness as well as a sense of spontaneity and raw abandon.

After the massive success of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the relatively modest returns for the sequel "Prince Caspian" baffled many. But it really shouldn't have. Absent the sense of discovery and wonder that made the first "Narnia" film so magical, what's left is a well-made but fairly rote sword-and-sorcery-and-talking-animal movie, lightly draped in religious allegory. The DVD adds a few featurettes and a commentary track by director Andrew Adamson, while the double-disc DVD and Blu-ray editions also include deleted scenes and hours of behind-the-scenes material.

Hughes, Campbell and Epstein create evocative characters, especially effective in their "Wake Me Up When September Ends" trio - a song with a different meaning for each man. Hughes sings "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" with a voice of banked fire and shows off an idiosyncratic, hopping dance step that's looks like a cross between unbridled energy and neurological impairment. That's probably a fair description of desire.

In the end, perhaps Botta's SFMOMA is a kind of ancient echo: With its Palladian symmetry, its cross-shaped windows and Moorish overtures in a contemporary shell, it is a Babylonian ziggurat and not a modern building at all -- simply one for the ages.
A mandrake wails in a shop window, owls hoot and turn in the rafters outside the Owl Post Office, and even the ATM gives a nod to magic as a branch of Gringott's, the wizarding bank.

"I can take Heidi and the boys along, work the races for about three hours, and the whole family can have fun when I'm done," he said. "It's a very different atmosphere than you'll find at the big race tracks. The crowd is there for many different reasons. I can cut loose and kick back a little."
But he did win, so a brokered convention doesn’t necessarily hurt the party and may help because it gets a lot of attention for the nominee; who may come out of nowhere and start fresh.
He's right.
"I would welcome someone in town that has a vision of what the township really needs," said Councilman Qunizell McKenzie, who represents the East Ward, where most of Irvington's crime occurs.

They cautioned, however, that it's unlikely any additional extensions will be allowed until after a run-update in May. Also, they said, if fishing gets extraordinarily good in the next few days, they could order a closure again when they reconvene next Thursday.
Notes: The biggest difference between A-10 play and the whole season is the numbers of Mike McCall. SLU's six-game win streak coincided with him moving into the starting lineup, but beyond that, he's had hands down the best numbers in that time. He's +72 in that run, in which SLU as a team is +88. So most of the time SLU is building a lead, it's with McCall on the court.

"Things are moving and changing in a good direction," Veerkamp said, but the county has been slow.
Hey, Hoynsie: I have been a huge baseball fan for a ton of years, but one thing I have never understood is why there are some positions that do not have any players who throw left-handed (i.e. catcher, third base, shortstop, and second base). Players who throw right-handed seem to have no limitations when it comes to position choice so why is the game not as generous to southpaws? -- Neal Sampson, Durham, N.C.

A bowl game remains, either the Fiesta, Sugar, Orange or Capital One, but once the seniors exited the turf at Ohio Stadium for the last time, the torch had been passed to a freshman class of which much is expected.

The Question: Back in August, I went to the Charter One bank in Euclid to cash out an 11-year-old U.S. Savings bond. When the teller told me the amount I'd get, I asked her to double-check because it seemed high. She did and stated that it was correct. I received $1,480.80. A few weeks ago, $690 disappeared from my bank account without warning. When I called to find out what the unknown debit was, Charter One said that they overpaid me for the savings bond, so they were taking the money back, and it wasn't my money so I should deal with it.

Mike Freeman, CBSSports.com: "Privately, when I've spoken to Giants officials, they laugh at the Jets. Literally laugh at them. They believe the Giants make moves to win and the Jets make moves to shock. This isn't stunning news; the two teams are intense rivals. What is shocking is how Tebow remains one of the most discussed topics among the NFL elite gathering for their annual meetings many miles away in a wealthy Florida enclave. One general manager told me he spent 45 minutes talking Tebow with a fellow GM; both have solid quarterbacks and were never interested in him. Other executives told me they spent time at dinner Sunday night reviewing the merits and faults of the trade. The general consensus, these executives said, is that the Jets have made a terrible mistake."
"I'm struggling but there are lots of opportunities starting to come," she said.
øFor example, we sell a lot of houses. We sell a Barbie Dream House, but we don't sell real houses. We sell more cars than anyone, but they're toy cars. What we see is that the most important thing for the customer is to get the right toy. After that, we want to make sure they get a great deal, and so we're giving that to them with, huge sales, big deals all the time. We've had "our lowest price ever" quite frequently on products. We have sales that start on Sunday, Wednesday sales and weekend sales. The customer comes out for them. They are looking for the right product and looking for a good deal.

After Cho broke down the statistics of every player's class -- grabbing the attention of everyone in the room -- he passed along some team statistics that reinforced his central point. If the Blazers had shot 5 percent better from the free-throw line last season, they would have won five more games. If the Blazers' defense had forced opponents to miss one more field goal a half -- two more per game -- they would have allowed the lowest field-goal percentage of any team in the NBA.

The group called college athletics a financial “arms race.”
The president has said that he wants to put Americans back to work. He has said Americans are only 5 percent of the world's consumers. He wants the 95 percent of the world's consumers to buy American products so as to level the playing field. Well, the playing field on which the 95 percent of the world's consumers exist is poverty.

This one-room eatery on East Sixth Street may be the best place to eat raw fish in Cleveland. The menu is extensive, with six-piece rolls, special rolls, big rolls and hand rolls. All these can be stuffed with raw seafood that is so fresh you would swear Cleveland is perched on an ocean rather than a freshwater lake. Folks who can't bring themselves to swallow anything that hasn't been cooked can still order sushi -- stick with the tempuras, California rolls, and vegetarian selections. And diners who just want a taste of something Japanese can select noodles, soups and teriyaki.
But the AJC’s review of dozens of Blue Ribbon applications suggests many warrant more scrutiny. Some cite phenomenal growth in test scores or a new principal who turned a school around.

"If police and fire put up $100,000 for your campaign, you win," he said. Then you go in a room and negotiate with the people who put you in office, he said.

Staton: "Well it means a great deal to an agency, to a law enforcement agency and to our public safety entities. I think what it means more to is to the community. The community realizes that there are only so many resources out there and there's only so many resources available to the citizens in any given area. To know that if something major like this transpires, whether it be this or some catastrophe or whatever, that you have an agency that's developed the bonds with the other agencies to be able to pool and support them and help the alleviate the costs across the board. But the key thing is the resources. We have certain resources in Multnomah County that Marion County may not have. Marion County has resources I know we do not have access to. Tualatin Valley, for instance, is another. You've got search and rescue groups from across the country because we search in different types of areas, different types of terrain. Different types of equipment are used. And to be able to pool those in a time of need, is significant."

Miss Carmen always provides a knife and fork, but I prefer to attack fried chicken with fingers, because that is the way fried chicken is supposed to be eaten at Munch's, a home-cooking place that opened a few months shy of six decades ago. Sometimes when I see newcomers using utensils, I know they must be from Indiana or possibly Chicago and can't possibly know how to eat fried chicken properly.

I've used Vermont for a shorthand description of Clementine's culinary inclinations and rugged good looks, but I think I'd do better with Portland, Maine, where a colony of young chefs have imposed their own wood-splitting style on the farm-to-table movement. You could safely place Blick in the head-to-hoof crowd. And though he runs easily with the followers of the local and the seasonal, he's been known to go rogue.

I wonder if Obama will be able to maintain the tolerant attitude he displayed Wednesday as the presidential campaign heats up.

Q: Please help me find a recipe for oatmeal cake. I had a neighbor some 40 years ago that shared a lot of recipes with me, and I made the oatmeal cake often. It was sort of a joke with my family because "first you cook the oatmeal" with a stick of butter or margarine, then add to the cake batter. After baking it goes under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the topping of coconut, milk or Milnot, brown sugar and pecans. It is a heavy cake, very moist and so delicious.
Local school officials would be required to ask parents how best to spend the money. Most of the money  70 percent  would be spread among all public schools, no matter whether they are in Davis, Beverly Hills or East Oakland. The money could not be used for teacher raises but could be used to hire teachers.

A regionwide sewer system would also eliminate the need for 400-plus private wastewater treatment facilities discharging into the lake, Koster's report said.
I typed the names of the neighborhoods into my smart phone and emailed myself the reminder. The names really didn’t mean much to me. I grew up in Lancaster, Pa. and had visited Baltimore somewhat regularly over the years, but we had always gone to the Inner Harbor or to Homewood Field, the Hopkins football stadium, to see my uncle play. I had never really explored the city.

Hey, Tony: Why all the panic? The Browns are a couple of breakdowns away from a 3-2 or possibly 4-1 record. That is not to say that I think the Browns have the talent to win consistently now, but any time you change a coach and subsequently your offensive/defensive systems it will take time for the front office to acquire the correct talent to run the systems and then it takes time for the players to learn and assimilate the information so they can run the systems well. Fans need to exercise some patience and trust that Holmgren and Heckert have the team's best interests in mind when they make decisions. -- Duane Showalter, Fox Lake, Wis.

The reason: partisan GOP mulishness over boundaries for 16 Ohio congressional districts.

Like other survivors, Kaur, 37, and her family are still living with the trauma of that night as they try to move forward -- cataloging what was lost, thinking about whether to return and rebuild, and taking care of daily responsibilities like going to work.

Another management challenge is avoiding isolation and finding ways to learn what employees are really doing and thinking. Many CEOs, Mr. Bryant writes, believe that it's a good idea to "get out and walk around." Deborah Dunsire of Millennium Pharmaceuticals routinely schedules walk-around time, during which she asks workers what is keeping them up at night and what they are feeling excited about. Bill Carter, a co-founder of Fuse, a marketing agency, confesses that he used to come back from his frequent out-of-town trips and retreat to his office. He soon discovered that "holing yourself up in your office is not the way to learn about what's happening in the organization."

Well, it seems they will and why not? Someone like Oquendo or Sandberg has been around enough and managed enough games at other levels that they know what they're doing and aren't going to make stupid mistakes. As Rangers GM Jon Daniels told me during the World Series, you can have inexperienced guys who know what they're doing, and experienced guys who don't. Now, would someone who's experienced and accomplished, like Terry Francona, be better than someone who's experienced and new? Maybe. There's always a safety for GMs to hire someone who has experience, because if you hire someone new and they bomb out, you look dumb. But the right new guy can be a great hire.

For kids, it may be easier to grasp the idea that underlies every kind of activism: Change Begins With Me. After all, for kids, everything begins with Me. They are less overwhelmed by the vastness of the world, more willing to see the direct line between their own light switch and, say, a polar bear habitat. Many adults treat such connections as if they were cute fairy tales — as if only a child could imagine that one little SUV had any bearing on world oil consumption! For such adults, "Reduce, recyle, reuse" might as well be "Eenie, meenie, minie, moe."
The day after Jon was born, a doctor told Jon’s parents that the first question for them was whether they intended to take Jon home from the hospital.

Arizona would be a nice fit for him. There's a warm climate, the option of a closed roof, and a wide receiver named Larry Fitzgerald. Surely the AZ coaches would give Manning the freedom to run the offense, and the Cardinals could be a playoff team in 2012. That's Manning's goal, to win as much as possible and take another shot at a ring before his career winds down.
Grgurich’s departure from the Blazers was not amicable. He was on Cheeks' staff when Cheeks was fired with 27 games left during the '04-05 season, and he remained to finish the season under interim coach Kevin Pritchard.

2. Would Jeff Samardzija have gotten a chance to start this season without the Cubs’ regime change? There’s no way to know but I sort of doubt it. As much as Jim Hendry loved him when he gave him $10 million to put down the football, his staff has pretty much concluded that Samardzija didn’t have the command or pitches to succeed. I can’t blame them, either. Samardzija had mostly started in the minors and had a 4.30 career ERA after almost 500 innings. That doesn’t scream big-time starter. But Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer decided to give Samardzija a chance to impress them, and he has. In fact, Epstein must wonder what would have happened if he had been in the Red Sox system late last season, when a lack of starting pitching depth triggered a 7-20 September. The win at Cincinnati on Wednesday night was impressive, as that can be a very tough lineup, in a very tough ballpark, for a right-handed starter. The only test left for Samardzija is how he holds up physically. He’s never thrown more than 141 2-3 innings in a season.

While I haven't seen all the films in this year's Frameline32, I'd still bet "The Edge of Heaven" is the best feature of the festival. Fatih Akin directs a film based on O. Henry-like interconnections between an old German man who asks a Turkish prostitute to live with him, his ever-tentative professor son and the prostitute's political-activist daughter, who falls in love with a German girl whose mother disapproves of the union. The film operates on several levels. While it looks at unexpected links between people, it also offers a metaphorical political message about how nations can join a common group and still maintain their individual cultures. The action is set against the candidacy of Turkey to join the European Union.
The next major bipartisan effort was the attempt by President Barack Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner to work out a grand bargain on raising the debt ceiling. It was reported at the time that the two sides were on the verge of agreeing to a two-stage strategy for raising the debt limit and cutting more than $4 trillion out of the federal budget through 2021. Reportedly, that plan would have included unprecedented cuts in spending, including at the Pentagon, and significant changes to Medicare and Social Security, the biggest drivers of future borrowing -- a major concession for Obama and other Democrats. But those negotiations collapsed and deteriorated into finger-pointing. Plenty of members of Congress made their feelings known about various reported deals, but there was never an actual vote on a long-term solution.

The plant has two main parts. In the stamping area, huge presses bend metal sheets into floor pans, door parts, lift gates and other parts. Of the hundreds of different parts stamped at Parma, only five are ever seen by car owners. The others go into the skeletons of their cars and trucks.
On the day I dropped by, Buddy seemed happy to have the company. It was just before his 37th birthday, and he had been a quadriplegic for 19½ years. In a football game during the fall of 1973 at William Tennent High School, where he had been a star quarterback who carried himself with the cocky attitude of his hero, Joe Namath, Buddy fractured his C-4 and C-5 vertebrae. It happened as he was running an option play; he had held onto the ball instead of handing off or passing. In a split second of horror in that game against powerful Plymouth-Whitemarsh, he was swept under in a pileup of tacklers, as if he were a surfer upended in a collapsing wave. It was a clean hit, yet devastating: Buddy would be paralyzed from the neck down.

The Rangers are going to need Dubinsky to be a reliable, hard-edged and productive player in the playoffs. He has been that. Last year Dubinsky was the team’s best forward in the five-game first-round defeat to the Capitals, even moving back to center when Derek Stepan struggled in his first best-of-7.
Rose's bitterness is a cloud over the band's induction, but in some ways fitting, given the dysfunction that marked the group as it rose to become one of the world's most popular acts in the 1980s and 1990s with hits like "Welcome to the Jungle," "Sweet Child O' Mine" and "November Rain."
I got a chance to play Pebble last year and it lived up to its reputation. In one round, my group experienced sun, rain, fog, wind, sideways rain and pure joy. The course can be diabolically hard, and completely straightforward. The greens are small. The views are huge. And the experience is out of this world. Don't expect to play the round of your life. Expect to experience the round of your life.

The essence of the First Amendment is the right of all to their own interpretation of religion, not just the right to their own convictions. To maintain that order of tolerance, the First Amendment mandates that the government must not establish religion, but rather allow the practices of all people. That is "the separation of church and state." The principle does not mean, as Rick Santorum mischaracterized it recently, that religious persons are banished from expressing their opinions in the public square. It does mean that government shall make no law that encroaches on the freedom of the exercise of religion by its citizens.

The Miami Heat beat the Knicks 104-94 to take a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round series. Carmelo Anthony scored 30 points but had just nine second-half points. Moreover, it was a loss that took a toll: After the game, Amar'e Stoudemire lacerated his left hand by punching a fire extinguisher and its glass casing, according to a person familiar with the situation. Paramedics rushed into the locker room to treat Stoudemire, whose hand was covered in blood. According to the person, Stoudemire threw the punch on the short walk from the court to the Knicks locker room. Stoudemire left the arena at 10:36 p.m., wearing a sling on his left arm; he did not comment and quietly loaded the bus from a back entrance. Many Knicks used a back door to exit in an effort to avoid the media. Landry Fields, standing by a loading dock, called the locker-room atmosphere "tough" and said he did not see Stoudemire's injury. Stoudemire did not go to a hospital and will stay with the team. A Knicks spokesman declined to say if Stoudemire will be ruled out for future games.

One of the reasons I was drawn to hip-hop in the first place was because I thought it sounded pretty. College rock of the '80s had a big, soggy, distorted rhythm guitar soaking up its midrange. (Come to think of it, it still does.) The drums were tinny and compressed. Contemporary pop was lousy with thick slapped bass and sick-cow synthesizers. In hip-hop, there was wide-open sonic space. It was possible to hear the nuances of the rapper's voice, and the rattle of the snare, without interference from vibrating strings. Even when the emcee's delivery was abrasive -- KRS-ONE, for instance, or Parrish Smith -- it always seemed to pull me into a colorful, inhabitable soundscape. I was used to music that was crammed to the brim with overdubs and filler noises. Hip-hop was the opposite of that. There was room for me.

“The One That Got Away” is a bit more sober than Perry usually is. It’s a love letter to an idealized high school boyfriend whom Perry misses. The look backward extends the obsessions of the “Teenage Dream” album. We don’t learn much about the boyfriend or the relationship besides some common — and unromantic — details: They listened to Radiohead together, raided the adults’ liquor cabinet and got matching tattoos. He’s less of a person than he is a romanticized road not taken.
DeFazio confirmed this morning that authorities are reviewing security footage and may glean some “valuable footage” from it.

Idaho deputy district attorney Robert Green tried to challenge Wyatt's testimony, playing a Portland police training video called "Be a Witness or Intervene: This Decision Requires Careful Consideration." The video instructs officers that the most important question to consider "is whether it's helpful or safe for you to take police action." The video, shown to officers last February, also urges officers to carry cell phones and, whenever possible, "defer to, or obtain assistance from appropriate law enforcement agency."

The bottom line for Republican legislators (and perhaps for Democratic ones, too, if they ever regain enough critical mass to figure in Snyder's legislative calculus) is that Snyder is unlikely to stand in the way of even your most dunderheaded ideas if you're willing to acquiesce to his own priorities.
Nachy Kanfer of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign said that, despite agreeing to the deal, his organization in principle does not support converting natural gas to aviation and motor fuel either.

is Cliff Cave, which is a short distant south on the trail. When you get to the fork, head east. It's a bit overgrown, but follow the stream directly to the big cave. This trail gets soggy in the rain so watch out for slippery spots where water can pool. The trail and the park include some bluffs. Do not rock climb without a permit.
A questionnaire that the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS) sent to Houston's Iman Academy SW in 2010 inquired as to whether Muslims believe the Bible is corrupt, what school officials thought about Christmas, and the "spread of Islam in America."

You must list both the name and location because we’re accepting only nominations for individual restaurants – so if the restaurant is part of a chain, we need to know which location you’re singling out. This is important; even if there are just two locations in our area, we need to know which one you're nominating. But you can nominate as many restaurants as you wish.

Both Burke's letter and the performance audit noted that several suggestions, including the creating of an overall strategic plan, had already begun since the audit was launched eight months ago.
For Rogen to land Katherine Heigl, she had to be drunk and then knocked up. But for ginger-haired Francois Damiens, with teeth too big and too far apart, and wearing oversize sweaters or undersize red jogging shorts, and with a bald patch on the top of his head, to win Tautou, his main weapon is a deferential sense of humor and a superhuman tactfulness.

"But I was talking with the guys (drivers) when they were driving passenger cars around the track this morning before getting into their race cars. They were very, very impressed with how smooth it was. That's when Brad tweeted he thought they were going to go 220 miles per hour. I don't think they are going to go 220, Brad, but youthful exuberance is most welcome."

The historic downtown building was built in 1917 and placed on the National Registry of Historic Places in 1985. Since the park district purchased it in 2008, it has spent $754,000 to replace windows, repair the roof and install gutters and add a sprinkler system. The renovation project was expected to completed in three phases: the second phase of the project was expected to cost $3.4 million and third phase was expected to cost $5-6 million, according to park district officials.

Tracy Martin, who maintains that his son was targeted because of his race, said he told the teen prejudices could lead to danger.
Why they’re here: Steve Spurrier has finally given in. He’ll no longer force a quarterback who can’t throw it consistently to toss it around 30 times a game. So he’s running the ball and playing defense and getting key throws off play-action. It led to 11 wins last year. It could lead to more in 2012.
The drink I'm featuring from Absinthe's new cocktail list this week wasn't created by Raglin, Hollinger or any of the talented crew at the brasserie, though. It was invented by a certain Wil P. Taylor, a man who had quite a reputation in Cuba in the 1930s.
The goal is to get travelers to commit now, rather than waiting until the last minute.
"In '94, I was trying to get elected and it was more of a political effort," he said. "I'm trying to get elected now, but getting elected isn't enough. ... The challenges we face here over the next year really need to be teed up during the campaign."
He says the officers were escorting a prison van, but no prisoner was hurt.
"Furnish" the master bath with a wood vanity and cabinets in a rich finish that would be nice enough to display in the bedroom or kitchen. Go with a granite or marble countertop. Select natural stone for the floor. Texture a backsplash with stone tiles or a textured finish like troweled-on clay. One showstopper is enough to make a room look special and new.
The Baltimore Grand Prix attracted about 160,000 spectators to watch cars roaring through streets around the Inner Harbor but left a trail of public and private debt, including about $1.5 million owed to the city in taxes and service fees.

Here was a leader who awarded government jobs to pretty starlets (some of them suspected of being his lovers), threw parties that allegedly featured strippers and hookers, and, through his vast media empire, bombarded Italy with images of women as playthings whose most important attributes for getting ahead were physical.
He'll deal with the changes then.

Charges of foreclosure-condition discrimination come on the heels of earlier complaints that lenders practiced "reverse redlining" -- targeting minority borrowers for expensive subprime loans with onerous terms that made foreclosure likely, and paying out bonuses to brokers when borrowers accepted loans with higher interest rates than they actually qualified for.

WASHINGTON - Congressional committees are widening their investigations into an alleged U.S. Secret Service scandal involving prostitutes in Colombia ahead of a recent trip there by President Barack Obama.
Thanks to Pacific Standard Time and in particular to the ongoing LACMA exhibition "Living in a Modern Way: California Design 1930-1965," L.A.'s Midcentury design pioneers are back in the spotlight. One of the best ways to dig deeper into this well known body of work is through the rich variety of short films made by the husband and wife team of Charles and Ray Eames. Collected in a six-DVD set, the series includes the classic "Powers of Ten" along with "Toccata for Toy Trains," "Day of the Dead" and my personal favorite, "Blacktop."
It would seem, having read most of what the paper of record has reported on this sad saga, that Mrs. Love is guilty of what she accuses of others. To wit, at some point in time, after one of her daughter's many brouhahas in Virginia, the two had a long tete-a-tete, then met overnight in Annapolis to discuss the upheavals in Yeardley's life. So, at what point did Mrs. Love have the responsibility to deal with her daughter's aberrant association with Mr. Huguely, for her to speak with the university's athletic director, etc.? Certainly, she was not without knowledge that things were bad or dangerous. Those will be very embarrassing questions for her to answer in discovery in this case.
Police say the slain woman and her daughter-in-law, who was also unharmed, were robbed at gunpoint last week a block away from their home in the crime-plagued city.
Boeing is also pitching its 787 as a major upgrade for travelers. It was designed with larger windows, more space in overhead bins and improved lighting.

As an activist, McFarlane could delight in his inner prankster, as he did when recalling the early days of ACT UP, a protest group that he helped found.
Morris' work isn't overtly agenda-driven, but nonetheless, "Beaux" proposes imagery that controverts the common notions of gender, and not just in dance. Do we find the ballet effeminate because Morris presents male interactions stripped of bravado and confrontation? Because the men are clad in Mizrahi's unitards speckled with bright pinks and yellows? Because they seem kind to each other? And more importantly, what does that say about our preconceived notions of what a "guys' ballet" should look like?
The product-quality watchdog said the new iPad can get as hot as 116 degrees Fahrenheit while performing processor-intensive tasks such as playing videogames for an extended period while plugged in. That temperature is 12 degrees more than the iPad 2, Consumer Reports said.

No high-speed rail service in the world was built without a successful conventional rail precedent.
The Packers' victory sends Green Bay to the Georgia Dome to play the top-seeded Atlanta Falcons on Saturday night. If the Bears beat the Seahawks and the Packers defeat the Falcons, the NFC Championship Game would not only be played at Soldier Field but would feature the league's longest-running rivalry. The Bears and Packers have only met once in the postseason, and that was in 1941.
Perry drew laughter as well as applause when he said that federal bureaucrats would experience pain as a result of his plans to cut spending, especially those in the departments of education, commerce and energy. That was a reference to his gaffe in an earlier debate when he couldn't recall the name of the third of the Cabinet-level agencies he has proposed eliminating.
Oregon has applied for a waiver from the No Child Left Behind act, the federal law requiring schools to show proficiency in reading and math. Under the governor's plan, Oregon would shake free of the No Child rules and instead rely on customized "achievement compacts" between the state and

7. Maverick (1994): Mel Gibson managed to bring the charm and swagger that James Garner did in the late 1950s/early 1960s TV show with his turn as the rogue gambler/good guy in this entertaining western. Good fun from Gibson, Jodie Foster and Garner himself as a marshal.
While realistically this is still so -- unless American voters are prepared to dispense with Medicare, Social Security, the Federal Reserve Board and even our existence as a sovereign nation-state -- at least rhetorically conservatives have a narrative advantage. That is, their story of individual freedom and tyrannical government enjoys a privileged place in the lexicon because of its association with our political origins.

With the playoffs starting later this month, this intensive focus on Rose is understandable. He almost single-handedly carried the Bulls to last year's Eastern Conference finals, where the Miami Heat dismissed them in five games.
Investors use yields on long-term debt to hint at the next flash point in the European debt crisis. For much of the past year, that meant Greece. However, market participants worried that losses arising from a Greek default would encourage banks and other institutional investors to offload holdings in the debt of other troubled members of the euro zone. Italy, in political disarray and with its own uncomfortably high debt level, inspired some of the worst fears in late 2011. Greece reached a deal with creditors in March, removing the risk of a messy default for now.

In his early 30s, he dominated U.S. road cycling, winning everything in sight. But he struggled in Europe, returned to the States, won more races and now, at the antique age of 37, he's making his second assault on Europe.

Even with a limited map, both candidates say the election will be — or should be — about big things. (Last week, however, the flap over stay-at-home moms illustrated the inevitable digression into matters that have little to do with voters' main concern, which remains the economy.)
Policymakers expected that by making access to the polls more convenient to underrepresented groups such as minorities and the poor, the cost — defined as time consumed and distance required to travel — would decrease and participation would increase.

2. Donnie Brasco (1997): For all of his portrayals of godfathers and Cuban drug lords, Al Pacino's best-ever turn may be in this film, as a low-level wise guy whose struggling crew is infiltrated by an FBI undercover agent (Johnny Depp). This underrated film is one of the best of the 1990s.

An examination of the caloric content of food from about 40 fast-food and sit-down restaurants in three states found that overall the stated calories of items on the menus were accurate.

"The Avengers" counter-programming: It takes a brave movie to be squashed at the box office by an über-blockbuster. But on Friday, two films aimed at the comic-book-clueless set are going up against the Marvel extravaganza "The Avengers," which could have one of the biggest opening weekends of the year. "Darling Companion" stars Diane Keaton as a woman devoted to a dog she found on a freeway and Kevin Kline as the husband who could be permanently in the doghouse when he loses the pet. It's directed by U-M alum and former Detroit ad copywriter Lawrence Kasdan. There's also "Damsels in Distress," indie director Whit Stillman's first movie in more than 10 years. It's about a group of female college students who fight the depressed state of an east coast college through good hygiene and musical-dance numbers. The perfect Stillman movie, 1990's "Metropolitan," has already been made, but anything with his odd sensibility is worth seeing.
Del Zotto, who also hit the post with a shot earlier in the period, fired a drive off the crossbar in the final minute that nearly got the Rangers even again.
"I love the way Chuck Berry doesn't waste time in his songs," Jurvanen said. "Even though the lyrics are sometimes cheesy, there's no irony because he did it from a place like, ‘Kids like cars. I'm going to sing about cars. Kids like soda fountains. I'm going to sing about soda fountains.' It was so deliberate. Musically, Neil Young is someone I admire. He doesn't waste a lot of time lyrically. He comes from some pure place where I believe every word. Willie Nelson has always been a fixture, mostly because his singing voice is so strong that he could sing anything and I would believe it.
A. Knee-replacement surgery has improved so much that even your older brother's version isn't your option. Now most docs will tell you to trade in your old joint for a new one when using it causes pain, especially severe pain that inhibits your lifestyle or your ability to stay healthy by being active. Women generally bear pain better than men (yep, we're babies!) and tend to put surgery off until their knees threaten to buckle under them.
Then he met his doppelganger, 36-year-old Sneeh of Syria, who immigrated in 2004. Sneeh taught psychology to troubled teens in Syria, and he wanted to escape the political tyranny in his country and continue teaching in the United States.

Sneeh sent money home to his younger sister, whom he has cared for since their parents died.
Republicans are trying hard to play this dispute to their advantage and win over religious voters, but they are not playing it smart. President Obama has already blunted most of the impact this issue might have among Catholic voters by compromising on the coverage requirement. As a result, Republicans do not seem to be gaining much traction with their accusations of an attack on religion, except among voters who are already on their side. But they are succeeding in scaring off independent females who are beginning to believe the real Republican agenda is to turn back the clock and limit access to contraceptives.

Ever since the former high-flying party chief of Chongqing was dismissed from his party posts, political insiders and analysts have suggested that the balance of power may have swung toward the reformist wing of the party, led by Premier Wen Jiabao, who has repeatedly called for unspecified political reform in the past two years and who disliked Mr. Bo's top-down model of government and advocate a greater role for civil society and the rule of law.

Cellist Maya Beiser is a worldly creature — raised in Israel to a French mother and Argentine father, Yale-educated, then a founding member of genre-blurring New York ensemble Bang On a Can All-Stars. For her sixth solo release, she commissioned 15-minute works for cello, oud and percussion from the Iranian Kayhan Kalhor (“I Was There” ) and Israeli Tamar Muskal (“Mar de Leche”) plus solo pieces from Armenian icon Djivan Gasparian (the haunted “Memories”) and American Douglas Cuomo. A voluptuous sadness binds the music, underscored by Beiser’s natural feel for the keening cantabile of Middle Eastern music. Her Bang on a Can compatriot Evan Ziporyn’s East-meets-West arrangement of Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” (for multi-tracked cello and drums) serves as a dramatic encore.

Evidence of caffeine's cancer-fighting powers has been, uh, brewing for a while. No one exactly understands how caffeine does what it does, but it definitely does something. In this case, the risk of basal cell skin carcinoma is 20 percent lower in women who drink more than three cups a day, compared with women who rarely touch the stuff. Men get protection too, but less, about 9 percent. What's a "cup"? A small, 8-ounce mug, with about 100 milligrams of caffeine. If you're drinking a medium container from a strong-java shop like Starbucks, you're talking 16 ounces and 320 milligrams of caffeine.

It all goes back to a serendipitous single slide, Nagele said. A former student who was working at Johnson & Johnson sent him a brain sample in 1999 for an opinion.

"Do you have any idea the politics that have been used to club me over the head and Republicans over the head?" Kasich said. "I think there's nothing inappropriate to the fact of letting people know what we've done, and if people want to help us, that's great. Period, exclamation point."

This is, after all, a state that can't afford to lose thousands of jobs; it's already been lagging behind in job growth. But Illinois also can't afford to keep giving away money: Its finances are a mess, and its pensions are among the worst-funded in any state.

ORDER A GIN AND JUICE at Booker and Dax, the new bar at the back of David Chang's Momofuku Ssäm Bar, and you'll receive what looks like a wine glass filled with water. Inside it is a mixture of Tanqueray and clarified fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice that is carbonated directly (to achieve fizz without any seltzer). Dave Arnold, 40, who is Mr. Chang's business partner at the bar, is also the drink's "inventor." His Son of a Peach cocktail is made with clarified canned peaches, tweaked for optimum sugar content by adding cane syrup with an electronic refractometer. Lady of the Night, a bloody mary riff, calls for horseradish distilled in a rotary evaporator. Mr. Arnold is currently the French Culinary Institute's director of culinary technology, teaching students how to cook with sous vide machines and transglutaminase, aka "meat glue."

One reason I can say this with confidence is that the Lifetime Savings Equivalent isn't a lot of money. According to the latest Retirement Confidence Survey done by EBRI, the Employee Benefit Research Institute, only 22 percent of all workers 55 or older had total savings and investments of $250,000 or more. Another 18 percent had total savings between $100,000 and $249,000. At the other end of the scale, 40 percent had total savings under $25,000. So any life decision with a value between $25,000 and $250,000 should get the attention of the millions of people who still work for a living.

But love has driven people to more extreme gestures. (Think "Anna Karenina.") In the end, one remembers the passion, and passion provides this volume with many enlightening and expansive moments. Here Hocking wonders if the odd bedfellows of game and story will someday find chemistry: "The question is, can we go … to completely different realms, using tools that are inherent to games? To let the player play the story, tell his own story, and have that story be deep and meaningful?" Hocking doesn't know, and neither does Bissell. Their uncertainty feels thrilling, testifying to a sense of possibility — and of risk — alien to more established creative forms.
Despite several name changes during the early years of his career, when he went from John Cougar to John Cougar Mellencamp to John Mellencamp, this guitar-strumming singer-songwriter has never wavered in his devotion to heartland rock 'n' roll. He also co-founded Farm Aid. A blunt, blue-collar rocker from Bloomington, Ind., Mellencamp beat the odds to become one of the enduring and respected stars of popular music. He credits at least part of his success to his sheer orneriness. "I've been very fortunate in that I've never been part of anything. I don't really get these guys who wear fur hats in the summertime for the attention. I never had any weird hair to get my songs over. That really has paid off in longevity."

Travel insurance is worth considering, however. For a relatively modest outlay, you can buy coverage that protects you if you have to cancel before or during your trip because you, your traveling companions or even a family member not traveling with you becomes ill and requires care.

But Nick does introduce Rosalie to Monroe. They come to the shop to try and figure out what the bad guys had been looking for. "I knew your brother," Monroe tells Rosalie, sticking out his hand. "I'm sorry." They look around and find "J," which isn't illegal, but, Monroe says, is so addictive it's like "meth mixed with rat poison and helium." Rosalie's not letting him go without double-checking something, though -- she grabs his arm and gets all fuchsbau. Monroe responds by going blutbad. "I just wanted to make sure," Rosalie says.

Borger said in his filings that the First Amendment requires parties who seek to restrict public access to court documents to demonstrate a compelling reason why the information should be kept secret. That wasn't done in this case, he said, nor has Davis made any findings that would justify a sealing order "as required by both the common law and the First Amendment when public access to judicial records is denied."

Now some Republicans are trying to find a way to squirm out of the defense cuts that are part of the penalty for the supercommittee's failure. President Obama is quite right to promise to veto any such legislation. The Pentagon budget surely needs to be reduced in order to bring down the deficit, but across-the-board cuts aren't the best way to do it. Still, a belief in Washington that there need be no consequences for a failure to act responsibly is what got us in this mess in the first place. The mandatory cuts the nation now faces don't go into effect until 2013, so there is theoretically time to strike a deal before the most damaging effects of the supercommittee's collapse are felt. But that won't happen if Congress votes to remove the noose it placed around its own neck.

We’re in a time of widespread street upheavals, when populations all over the Middle East and as far afield as Burma and Cuba are declaring they’ve had enough of their rulers.

In 1992, former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley led the charge for the passage of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which outlawed sports wagering in all states, but he grandfathered in the four states that had some form of it.

The new policy brings the company in line with Google Inc., which dominates the industry, and Microsoft Corp., which powers Yahoo's search results under a partnership reached last year.

"There are a lot of misunderstandings about what our policies are," McDonald said. "One of the most common is that we're assessing fines for violations that are not similar. If there's a critical violation, inspectors do not have the discretion to not write it up — that's the law. It wouldn't be much of an enforcement without a write-up. We give them a warning, then $250 for a critical violation. Are we fining more? Yes. That was the agreement."

As they lined up on the field the Cor Jesu players were handed the trophy no one wants. Given time and perspective, second place is a pretty impressive achievement. But in the moments after your championship dreams lay shattered on the turf, it doesn't feel all that impressive. It feels like every other team that entered that tournament. It feels like the season has come to an end with a loss. It feels like agony.
